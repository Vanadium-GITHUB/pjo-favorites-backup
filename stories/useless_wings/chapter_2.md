<strong>
Well, here we are again. It's really late.

And I have no idea where this is headed. But hey. It's fun to write so I wrote another chapter.

Btw, you guys have any ideas for this?

### Chapter 2
Petrified, Annabeth had scurried home. Relentlessly, her heart hammered and shivered in her panic filled chest. Her fear driven legs nimbly carried her across the jocky forest floor, weaving between the shrubs and trees until she broke out unto the road again.

For a few finger biting seconds she stood there, gazing wide eyed back into the dense forest. A few hollow breaths making her figure swell and deflate dramatically.

There was a feeling knotting in her gut.

The feeling that she had been followed, being watched.

A feeling that made her feel dreadfully small in comparison to those massive trees reaching out to the sky as if they wanted to fly as well. Anxiously, her wings vibrated in the twine securing them together. Raising her irritation level to a max.

Shaking off the jitters in her blood, Annabeth got into her car, fumbling again with those gangling keys.

A nervous wreck, she drove home, pounding up the stairs to her room and jumping onto her little laptop.

Hours were spent that evening researching, wondering, typing in question after question that went unfulfilled.

She didn't tell her mother that night. She was too scared to. Scared that she never saw anything to begin with. That she had been hallucinating or daydreaming.

Poppycock, that's what her mother would say to such a story anyways. Pure and ridiculous balderdash.

Besides, if her mother figured out that she had snuck off to those woods again she'd be in for a good tongue lashing and an extra week's worth of pots. And oh how Annabeth hated to do pots.

Malcolm would probably just roll his stormy eyes at her while affectionately patting her head. 'Some imagination you've got there.' he'd say with somewhat of a chuckle.

But it wasn't imagination. It couldn't of been imagination.

The image of that guy swooping out of the crystal blue sky, the serious demeanor on his dark features when he was threateningly standing over her, the sensation of the air buffeting off his massive black wings and combing through her hair.

It was too vivid, too alive to just be a delusion. To be labeled as a trick in the mind and to be forgotten.

So, thought provoked and extremely weary in her mind, Annabeth walked toward school with her shoulders hunched and quizzical yet serious eyebrows focused to the ground.

"Top of the morning General!" Piper called out at their meeting spot. Her braided chocolate hair was flicked over her shoulder while she gave a satisfying salute.

Giving a quick quirky smile, Annabeth grabbed Piper's arm a little urgently. "Pipes, listen-"

"We've got another scathingly brilliant mission?" Piper asked hopefully with a little twinkle sparkling devilishly in her eyes.

"Uhâ€¦ no." Annabeth continued hesitantly. "Yesterday, just after school, I went to the greenstrip. You know, by old Mcfanny's place?"

"You little rebel, you're not allowed out there." Piper smirked while bumping shoulders with her.

"Not the point Pipes." Annabeth chastised. "While I was out there, I saw a boy."

"Was he hot?"

"Does that hardly matter!?"

"Well I suppose not." Piper offhandedly decided with a faint shrug.

"Pipes, you don't understand. This boy, this thing! His wings!" Annabeth rambled on, unable to completely get what she actually meant out of her mouth. Her hand gestures were carelessly thrown around to make up for the lack of descriptiveness.

"What? What about his wings?" Piper asked impatiently, her stride gaining a little bounce from her curiousity.

"They were huge! Massive black fans that just sprouted out to the sky! It was unbelievable! And that's not all! He was flying Piper. Flying. He soared down suddenly and scared me to pieces."

Piper gave her an unusual look. Her perfect eyebrows slanting in perplexion as she stopped walking to tilt her head to the side. The slight part of her lips gave her the what the darndest hec? look.

Suddenly her features morphed into a joyous grin and she shook her head amusingly. "Oh I get it!.This is one of your little jokes!" she giggled.

Annabeth scowled while straightening the strap of her book bag a little contemptuously.

"I'm telling you." she cried in exasperation. "There was a boy in those woods! He could fly! I saw it!"

Pipers smile melted and molded into a look of confusion. "You're serious? No jest?"

"Why would I joke about something like this?" Annabeth moaned.

"Well." Piper reasoned. "You have had a considerable grudge against wings for quite awhile. You could be setting the story up as a joke and then when I asked 'really?' you would've declared a solid 'no' and made your statement on how useless the wings are."

"Point made." Annabeth grumbled with a huff.

"So you were just fooling?" Piper tried to clarify with her hand resting on her book bag.

"No!" Annabeth cried. "I really did see him."

"And you're absolutely sure of this." Piper gave her a sideways glance that was unreadable.

"Yes!"

"Even though you know it's biologically impossible?" the cherokee girl persisted.

"Yes!"

"And you know that heat can give you hallucinations."

"Piper! Do you believe me or not?!" Annabeth crossed her arms. Feeling a little guarded and betrayed.

Piper hesitated. Her wings drooping slightly as she let out a sigh. "I would like to believe you Beth, honest I would. But it just isn't possible. Ask any teacher, they'll tell you."

"But Pipes-"

"Beth please. I'm sure that their isn't a person out there who hasn't dreamt of flying. Myself included. Maybe you let that brain of yours wander off for a second." Piper was giving her a sympathetic look.

Silently Annabeth was hissing. Realizing that Piper would never believe. No one would in fact.

Annabeth's snow white wings twitched, her expression blank.

"Well I saw what I saw." she whispered stubbornly. Acting like the victim of a horrible offense. "If I didn't I don't think I'd ever be able to trust my own mind."

Piper looped her arm with Annabeth's chummingly. "Don't be glum about it." the chirpy girl tried to cheer up her friend. "I'm sure everyone sees something that isn't real now and again."

Annabeth snorted. "Ya, those are the people who get tossed into the looney bin."

"Well, at least you'd fit in." Piper teased as they walked. Her smile creeping back onto her face like a disease.

Annabeth chortled. "Come off your high horse Pipes. If I'm crazy then you're twice so."

"And proud of it!" Piper declared with a defiant fist punching the air. "There's nobody else I'd rather be than me!"

Laughing lightly, Annabeth elbowed Piper playfully in the ribs. "Than I don't see why you always complain about the complexion of your wings."

Piper just grumbled to herself with a pout. Then, scooping up a pebble she tossed it between hands carefully. "Wings are complicated things." she breathed while blowing air out of her cheeks. "If I wasn't part cherokee, I'd probably have pure white wings like my mom. Like you."

"But then you'd look less like Piper." Annabeth pointed out with a huff. "And that, I'm afraid, is something I don't think I'd be able to stand."

Piper smiled impishly. Almost like a bizarre thank you. Then, with a heavy swing she catapulted the stone at the deteriorating wooden sign of their snooty school.

"Nice shot." Annabeth complemented with a grin when the bundle of minerals struck the sign in the exact center. Dully knocking against the wood while leaving a decent sized chip.

"Thank you. Should we get sodas after school to celebrate?"

"What? You hitting the sign? I hardly would consider that celebration worthy. You probably just want a soda." Annabeth scoffed and shook her head with a smile.

Piper winked. "Ah, you know me too well my friend." she clucked her tongue. "So that's a yes?"

"But of course."

-{:oOo:}-

"Mrs. Dodds is the worst." Piper grumbled while rubbing her neck.

The streets of downtown were clogged with cars and pedestrians alike. The clingy humid air seemed to coat their throat in a layer of slime while simultaneously make little bubbles of sweat leak onto their skin. It parched Annabeth's mouth while making her yearn for that fizzing drink she was planning on.

"All I did was cough too much to earn another three lunch detentions of cleaning chalk boards!"

Annabeth only laughed at her friend humorously. "Shall we seek vengeance on her tomorrow then?"

"Oh? Another scathingly brilliant mission?"

"Indeed, I think so. After all, Mrs. Dodds has given you all of lunch break preciously alone in her classroom. It be a sin not to tamper with at least something." Annabeth smirked.

Piper squealed while they walked up to the door of 'Oliver's shakes, ice cream and burgers'.

"I can't wait! What do you have planned thi-" rudely she was interrupted by the glass door swing open and knocking her off her feet. A thick 'clunk' sound hanging in the air from her head to glass contact.

Annabeth was instantly at her side. "Pipes! Piper! You alright!?"

"Oh my gosh!" someone gasped. Another figure bending to her aid with a concerned look on their face. "I'm so sorry! I'm afraid I'm a terribly clutz!"

Dazed Piper rubbed her eyes. "I'mâ€¦ I'm alright. But my book bag? Where did it fall?"

Annabeth clucked her tongue at her friend. "This is why you wear your strap over your head you ding dong!" she chastised while looking around for the pesky brown bag.

"Is this it?" the stranger asked docilely while holding out Piper's bag carefully.

Piper only stared enchantedly at the person. Her lips slightly parted with a blush rising up her cheeks. Subtly, her wings shifted and gave off a shiver or two.

In confusion, Annabeth looked up to the person.

Then it made sense.

It was a boy. A teen. With light blonde hair combed to the side and a muscular build. Lightning blue would be the colour Annabeth would use to describe his eyes as he looked on at Piper in concern.

Near the corner of his lip was a little white cleft of a scar while his simple t-shirt and jeans was the style currently right up Pipers alley.

"You sure you're all right?" the stranger asked when she didn't accept the bag burdened with books. He pushed the dark rimmed glasses up his nose delicately, this time offering her a hand.

But Piper was currently shell shocked. Her wings starting to flutter and flap nervously at the most embarrassing time possible. It sent little puffs of air up her back and shifted the loose tendrils of hair around her face.

"She's fine!" Annabeth intervened while helping her speechless friend to her feet and dusting off her kilt. "She's a trooper if I ever knew one."

Piper just stood there fish mouthed. It took a little shin kick in order to jump start her talking ability.

"Right." she proclaimed loudly. "Trooper, yeah. I once got kicked- hit- I mean, smashed through a window head first."

"Whoa," the blonde dude gave her a uncertain look. "Were you okay?"

"I was but the manager blew a fuse." she chuckled nervously, rearranging her hands in different positions as if she couldn't make up her mind. Lightheaded, she stumbled back a pace.

Annabeth caught her forearm concerned. "Maybe you got a hard knock to the noggin than you think Pipes."

With a wary hand to her temple Piper groaned. "I just might've. I feel kinda woozy come to think of it."

"Why, you should get out of the heat. Come, sit down inside." like a gentlemen he offered while widely gesturing to the door.

"Thank-you, But Beth can-"

With a devilish thought, Annabeth faked a gasp in surprise. "Oh Piper! I completely forgot! Mother wanted me home to help her bake some pies for the relatives coming over on Sunday!"

Pipers eyes narrowed. A look of panic seeping into her face.

"But Beth!..."

*You don't have any close relatives!... And you're mother can't bake to save her life!* Was written hilariously all over her pretty little face.

"Oh, please make sure my friend's alright won't you?" Annabeth sent a big pleading eyed look at the boy. Acting like a weak blonde to trip him into it.

The boy didn't hesitate. "Well it's all I can do after my mistake-"

"Oh splendid!" Annabeth grinned at Piper who was giving her a death look.

"Thank youâ€¦..?" she trailed off expectantly. Cleverly implying for his name so Piper could have at least something to call him by before she was abandoned.

"Jason." he filled in with a polite nod.

"Piper!" Piper yelled bluntly for no particular reason. Out of nerves perhaps.

*Euh, what a daft idiot.* Annabeth rolled her eyes .

"Pardon?" he looked perplexed and severely weirded out. Maybe a touch offended.

"Her names Piper." Annabeth filled in helpfully with an internal groan. "I'm Annabeth. Anyways, it was nice meeting you Jason. I'd better be off."

Then, with a hidden wink to Piper who tried as she might couldn't get a word out, Annabeth nearly skipped away. Chuckling to herself while wondering how her friend would fare without her.

*She'd probably blush and flutter and squirm in her seat. What a bashful thing she is.*

As for Annabeth.

Annabeth was headed for a place with all her unanswered questions.

With everything she was pining to know.

Massive jet black wings just don't grow on tree's y'know.

-{:oOo:}-

This time, she was prepared.

Eagerly, she'd thrown her bag carelessly on the trimmed lawn. Collecting her notebook, pencil, compass, some hot cheetos, a water bottle with a spritz of lemon, and her carving knife. Shoving them into a bag and slinging it over her shoulder roughly.

She rode her bike to the spot. Swinging the bike lock chain around the nearest tree, she hopped into the forest.

Inhaling the damp cool air quietly while relishing the smell of soft moss on cooling rocks. Every second her eyes were out wide. Scanning each breaching tree, running along each splitting branch. Ready to crouch down at any second. To hide.

Slip away from sight.

Carefully, she weaved her way around some rocks and trudged on. Nimbly hopping over fallen trunks of decaying bug riddle trees and nervously grasping at the ends of little saplings just barely reaching her knees.

Nothing.

She wandered for at least two hours. Inspecting the clearing over and over. Checking and rolling the compass over in her hand while her eyes were forever skyward.

She found a few crows nests, some small sparrows gathering dead grass, deer prints fresh in the spongy soil, and even the pellets of an owl. At one point she forgot her entire mission and instead was content to lie on her belly in the underbrush and watch a few fox kits scamper around while their mother kept a sharp eye on Annabeth. Ready to herd them into the den if she moved a muscle.

When her feet ached and shoulders burned. When her wings were drooping dejectedly. Annabeth plopped down on the first decently strong log and took out her large bag of hot cheetos. While watching the blanket of green leaves above dance she mumbled a few things to herself in almost protest at her lack of findings.

*If he was really there than there has to be SOME kind of evidence. Proof.*

Disappointed she tossed another handful of the spicy goodness into her mouth. The evening songs of the finches and little robins flowing into her ears.

Abruptly, there was another noise. A sound of leaves brushing together and twigs snapping.

In an instant Annabeth was on her feet. Slipping her bag off her shoulder to achieve her maximum agility.

A forgotten fistful of cheetos still grasped in her hand from exhilaration as she crept forward. Angling her feet to not disturb the bracken.

With her heart rate rising and not a coherent thought in her mind she peeked behind the trunk of the birch tree she was cowering behind.

Two beady eyes behind a mask blinked back at her. Then a string of hisses escaped the little creature's mouth like cusses as the fur on its haunches raised by an inch. Its canine like teeth flashed under its black lips.

"Just a coon." Annabeth muttered to herself in disappointment.

She expected the little raccoon to dodge off into the forest again or maybe attack her if he had enough gusto.

Instead he seemed to get over his fear in an instant and crawled forward curiously, occasionally lifting its face to sniff the air. His poofy ringed tail swishing back and forth as he moved.

*What the?*

He came in closer, as she knelt down to his level. This time standing on his back paws and nodding his head back and forth, perpetually sniffing as if he were testing for explosive gases or trying to clear his wet button nose.

"You're awfully comfortable with a human for a wild raccoon." Annabeth muttered as she watched him in curiosity. "Are you some ex-pet or something?"

Intently, the raccoon pushed passed the little thorn brush and reached out towards Annabeth left hand. Still a good foot away and looking flighty in his movements. Wary of Annabeth.

For good reason of course.

Annabeth unpried her fingers, remembering the stash of cheetos that had ripened in her sweaty palm and now stuck to her skin like leeches.

As an offering of friendship she dropped the little pile of gunky cheesy mess up and hopped back a pace. Watching the little coon with a sort of fascination.

The animal hesitated. Then, greedily he reached his black padded hand forward and grabbed them all with two paws before scampering off like a guilty thief about to be caught red handed.

Annabeth chuckled to herself while wiping the cheeto dust off on her jeans. Tightening her ponytail, she turned spritely to pick up her things when her blood turned icy in her veins.

Her things.

Her bag had been emptied onto the log and tossed aside like a piece of litter. The full plastic bag of cheetos and her carving knife were missing along with her water bottle. The leather shoulder bag was hung against the bark of the wood without care, visibly empty with its flap flipped open.

All that was left was the pencil and pad of paper which had dropped to the ground.

In a seize of panic Annabeth grasped at her pocket.

Her compass.

Her golden compass with the intricate flip up lid and delicate patterns hammered in the sides.

*Still there.* She sighed in relief. Thankful that she had had left it in her pocket instead of that bag. Thankful that it didn't get heartlessly stolen like the rest of her belongings.

Miffed, Annabeth grabbed the sack and tossed her crinkled notebook and dull pencil in. Angered that she could literally be robbed blind.

But her suspicions were confirmed, her proof found, when a single black feather caught her eye in the nook of a crack in the bark.

Plucking it up, Annabeth grinned as she put it up to the light.

"Gotcha." she muttered with a smirk.
