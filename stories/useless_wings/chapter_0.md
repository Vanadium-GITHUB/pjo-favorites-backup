# Useless Wings by Average Canadian

<a href = "https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5454417/Average-Canadian"><strong>Average Canadian</strong></a>

## Summary
Everyone is born with a pair of wings. Tiny fluttering things that wouldn't be able to support anything larger than a turkey. Flimsy and weak. Sometimes wilting or growing stubby and scruffy. Annabeth's wings always seemed so pointless to her. She couldn't fly, nobody could. Or at least that's what she thought, until a certain green eyed boy was hovering above her. AU. Percabeth.
