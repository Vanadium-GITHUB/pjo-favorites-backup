<strong>
Octavian is a sexual harasser. Don't be like Octavian.

### Chapter 10
*She works hours and hours a day, and can't spare me a minute. But when it comes down to buying a dress for me to impress Mrs. Aresto. She's got all the time in the world.* Annabeth sniffed miserably as she looked at herself in the mirror. Head to toe looking fabulous and having spent the last three hours in 'quality time' with her mom.

*Quality time my ass.* She cursed dishearteningly. *Mom barely talked to me at all…*

And yet her mother found time to weave and spray and tease her hair into a braided chignon. Her mom found time to nip at her to sit still as she layered her face in makeup. Explaining how the dark brown eyeshadow, and black eyeliner and mascara brought out her eyes. How the rouge matte lipstick made her lips look fuller and more lovingly sculpted. How the contouring and foundation gave her face a flawless look.

Explaining it all but sighing at the way she slouched, they way she moved too much, they way she wasn't paying attention enough.

Now Annabeth was alone in her little green room. Standing quietly and patiently in front of her mirror, and hating the reflection that returned to her. Hating how she looked good, and elegant and *perfect*. She hated perfection.

Shifting her silver clutch to her left hand she ran her fingers over the smooth fabric of the dress. Disgusted how it hugged her body, yet left her knees bare. Hating how it clung to her boobs, and her butt as if she were wrapped in nothing more than a few layers of navy muslin cloth.

And yet it looked *good*. She looked good.

Her delicate dangling earrings sparkling like her silver clutch and her silver killer heels.

It pulled the entire look together in a classy way.

"Annabeth!" Her mother called from down the stairs. Her voice as starchy as ever. "We must leave! The chauffeur is waiting!"

"Coming!" she called as she attempted to make a graceful descent down the stairs. Her strappy heels making her stumble slightly on each step.

*Grace dumbass.* Her mind chided. *Step with GRACE.*

With a aggravated sigh, Athena shook her head at Annabeth. Eyes raking up and down her body as she found everything wrong with the daughter in front of her.

"Remember, heel to toe while walking in such high heels." Her mother chastised with a scowl. "What did I pay to give you lessons for child? I expected more than this!"

"Sorry mother." Annabeth stated robotically. Her heart sinking. *Can't I do it right?*

"And for heavens sakes, keep your gut in." her mother remarked stingily. "You've got a bit too much pudge around the midsection. A lady doesn't have *pudge*."

"Yes mother." Annabeth looked to the floor to hide her tearing eyes. Gripping her clutch tightly and hating her perfectly manicured nails.

"And don't think I forgot what state you were in when you walked through the doors. Wings fruffled, hair a mess. Even your clothes were wrinkled and disgusting. Whatever activity you did at Pipers made you look like a god forsaken hobo." Annabeth hid her cringes behind her mask as her mother laid it upon her thickly.

"That's enough Mom, the girl looks fine." Malcolm suddenly appeared strolling down the stairs. His hair combed to the side, and wearing a neatly pressed pair of dress pants and a blue button up shirt.

"Malcolm! Are you coming?" Annabeth asked hopefully with excitement dazzling through her eyes. Leaning onto the railing as her brother shot her a sympathetic look.

"Annabeth! A lady does not speak unless spoken too. I will not have you acting so preposterously in front of the Aresto's! Especially Clarice's husband!"

Annabeth bit her tongue as another jab of pain entered her heart.

*Screw up. Just do it right already.*

"Apologies Mother." Annabeth offered meekly. Her tired bones feeling just about ready to crack. Her shoulders hurt, and her head nothing but foggy from the lack sleep she had that night. It didn't help that she was being pushed to her limit with impressing the Aresto's and her mother.

Athena raised a disappointed eyebrow at her that made Annabeth's heart squeeze.

"Well to answer your question, then yes. I am coming. Mom wanted me to meet Octavian I believe his name was?" Malcolm intervened trying to take Athena's attention off Annabeth for a second.

Annabeth only shuddered. Even the sound of his name on the air was bitter to hear. Never wanting to see that boy again, but not having much of a choice.

"Yes, and Mr. Aresto has come from the city so I will be very keen on introducing both of you to him. That is if you stay on your best behaviour."

"Yes mother." Annabeth offered obediently. Her spine straight and her figure poised.

*Don't screw this up. Don't screw this up.*

"Sure." Malcolm agreed offhandedly. Making Annabeth more than jealous at how easy he had it. How their mother never seemed to find a problem in the world with him.

"Come along then. We mustn't be late."

-{:oOo:}-

Annabeth felt sick to her stomach as she was lead up the marble stairs all over again. This time the night air feeling refreshing on her tired body before they were enclosed into the building. Brilliant lights dazzled them as they walked into the grand front hall with the magnificent chandelier.

Mrs. Aresto babbling on and on about how pleased she was to finally meet the man of the house again. Cooing and complimenting Malcolm in every way, as Malcolm stood there handsomely and managed to seamlessly produce witty replies.

"You must meet my son." Mrs. Aresto declared. "He's just your age! Why you two played together as boys!"
"I'm afraid I don't remember those times." Malcolm chuckled. "It's been many years."

"And I never expected you to have such a stupendous memory!" Mrs. Aresto waved at him teasingly as she lead them forward down tall spacious halls. Passing family portraits of stuffed up looking gentlemen and grisly old ladies. Beautiful sculptures hidden in alcoves of the hall, and a glass ceiling that displayed the millions of stars.

*Heel to Toe.* Annabeth focused solely on her walking. *Fluid movements. Nothing gawky you screw up.*

Mrs. Aresto led them on and on. Twisting through places of the house and giving comments about passing servants or maids.

Malcolm twisted his head to shoot Annabeth a dumb face which she couldn't help but smile at. Thankful that he was here with her this time to at least make it bearable.

"Here, we shall dine." Mrs. Aresto held the old oak door open for her guests. Beckoning them into a lavish and spacious dining room that made Annabeth sigh internally at how perfect it was.

She really really hated perfect.

It was victorian inspired, that much was evident. How the pale cream walls were encrusted with intricate molds and embellished corners. The marble fireplace was masterfully carved with flowers and angels, and fixed with a wrought iron pit that looked like it hadn't been used a day in their lives. The polished wooden floor had a pale persian woven rug on it where the antique wooden dining set was laid out with precisely six table settings. Two bright and winding chandeliers over each end of the table.

Framing the room, and setting the mood was the high paneled curved windows with flowing silk curtains that were tied to the sides in tasseled ropes to show off the moonlit lawns, and acres of garden.

Malcolm whistled lowly. His eyes moving around the room easily as he scanned it. Another twang of jealously enveloping Annabeth as Athena didn't bat an eyelash at Malcolm's whistle.

"You've got quite the beautiful place here." he complimented while sliding his hands casually into his pockets.

"I've always thought so. Thank you." Mrs. Aresto beamed as they formed a comfortable circle around her. Annabeth noting how she always seemed to dress so formally when guests arrived. Her black and white designer dress looking crisp and smooth. How her brown hair was always in ship shape, and not a hair out of line. Even her pale cream feathers were perfectly preened.

*I wonder how she looks when she wakes up…*

"Athena!" A voice boomed as a new person entered the room. The sturdy man was undoubtedly Mr. Aresto. The same blonde hair, and pale blue eyes but with a dark tan to his skin and some muscle to his bones. His gull like wings tucked behind him formally as he grasped Annabeth's mother's hand in greeting.

"It's a pleasure to see you again Apollo." Athena smiled graciously.

"You as well." he beamed. Sliding his hands into his pockets as they returned a few other pleasantries. The usual 'how's the business going' and 'what's your success rate this year?'. Annabeth on the other hand had to fight down her reflexes. She almost belted Octavian in the gut when he slyly slipped up behind her and set his hand on her lower back. A bit too low, if you know what that means.

"I'm delighted to see you again gorgeous." he muttered with a creepy smirk. Acting as if he were the most charming man in the world.

For a panicked second, Annabeth felt cornered. Like any child would she looked to her mother for guidance but found all other adults enveloped in a very engaging conversation about business. She felt uncomfortable with him being this close and this outwardly bold, but what was she to do? Tell him to back off and have her mother 'embarrassed?'

No, she couldn't do that. All her life she dreamed of making her mother proud, and for the first time she had gotten somewhere in that field. That was her last resort.

Maybe she could tell him politely?

No, Octavian seemed to be the blunt type. He'd take offense to any word she said against him. How was she to get out of this?

Nervously, her wings shook slightly. Her cheeks growing hot as the anxiety starting eating away at her mask.

*SAY SOMETHING YOU DUMBASS!*

"Hello Octavian." she managed smoothly. *Kindly remove your hand.* She was thinking. Thinking, and rolling the phrase over in her mind but never saying it.

Octavian seemed to take her tongue tied state, and shivering wings another way. His hand shifting on its position and sending waves of prickles down Annabeth's neck as she fought to keep it cool.

"You needn't be so flustered." He grinned. "It's only me, and I assure you have the all the reason to feel at home."

Annabeth's chest felt tight. She couldn't breath his awful cologne. She just wanted to be as far away from Octavian as possible.

"You must be Octavian." Malcolm suddenly interjected. Annabeth's tense shoulders falling in relief as her older brother naturally pried himself between her and Octavian.

His cool facade seeming friendly and neutral, but Annabeth could see the glint of anger flickering in his eyes. How he kept his body between the two of them like a barrier.

*Thank you.* Annabeth cried internally. Liberated from his intrusive hands.

"Why yes." Octavian looked a little peeved, but welcomed Malcolm's attention nonetheless. "And you are?"

"I'm Annabeth's older brother, Malcolm." he introduced with a courteous offer of his hand for a formal handshake. He didn't say Athena's son. He didn't just say 'Malcolm Chase'. He said *Annabeth's older brother*. A threat hidden in those words as he continued his warm conversation.

"I've heard you hold an interesting trophy room." Malcolm continued. Keeping Octavian engaged as he started to somewhat dominantly lead him away by expecting him to follow. Octavian wandering away willingly while the subject of his pride and joy was being spoken of.

*Thank you!* Annabeth mouthed when Malcolm glanced back at her with concern in his eyes. Making sure she was alright.

For a moment Annabeth just stood there. Relieved from Octavian's pervertedness and uncomfortable presence. Allowing her exhaustion to show in one second with a dismal sigh before she set her mind back into making her mother proud.

Seamlessly, Annabeth shadowed the other conversation which had drifted to the discussion of lower class life and the repulsive state of slum living citizens. Annabeth watched curiously as Athena nodded enthusiastically to every big opinion Apollo had while sharing her own fears of her children falling into any lower class than they already were.

"Oh they won't dear. Trust me." Mrs. Aresto giggled. Fanning her hand ridiculously. Athena actually sharing a smile with the dame. Annabeth was too out of it to notice. Her head was throbbing with webs of pain. All she could do was stand quietly and watch as the people before her moved their lips and shifted on there feet.

Finally, as the minutes trickled away, a coat tailed butler entered stiffly and bowed in a stupendously low fashion. His face expressionless as he announced that dinner would be served.

"Oh splendid!" Mrs. Aresto smiled. "Shall we take our seats then?" she asked the rhetorical question as if she expected an answer. The guests moving towards the well equipped table.

*Heel to toe.* Annabeth reminded herself. Gripping her clutch tightly instead of wincing at her cramped toes.

"Please, allow me." Octavian slithered up behind her again. Pulling her chair away from the table like an everyday gentleman. His very presence making her stomach feel like a pit of snakes.

"Thank you." She replied softly as he scooted the chair in. Not being able to shake the feeling that he was staring down her v-necked dress. Wishing more than ever now that she was in a turtleneck instead of this tight navy thing hugging her body.

Annabeth's heart sank dramatically when Octavian pulled back the chair next to her to sit down. Readying herself for a long unenjoyable dinner.

However, before Octavian could sit down, Malcolm appeared and took the seat. Thanking Octavian cordially as he scooted the chair in and began unfolding his napkin. Pretending as if he didn't notice at all that the seat wasn't for him. Gratitude bursting through her veins in warm bursts for her brother's presence. So thankful that he saw how uncomfortable Octavian made her and acted on it.

Octavian however looked as if he were about to protest, but instead made his way around the table to sit quietly next to Athena. Somewhat sulking as he shot Malcolm a hidden look of distaste.

*I don't know what he wants from me.* Annabeth thought as she observed the pale guy. *But I know he wants it as fast as he can get it.*

Annabeth stared at the table setting in front of her to avoid the obvious stare Octavian was giving her. His pale eyes never leaving her figure.

*Formal Dinner Setting.* She observed as she tried to shake her nerves. Noting the elegant silver cutlery and the abundance of eating materials. The three shining forks to her left for salad, fish, and then dinner, the two knives and a spoon to her right for fish, dinner and soup. The spotless white china dinner plate with hand painted gold patterns and matching mini version above her forks for buttering bread on. Three crystal wine glasses for red wine, white wine, and water. Finally the extra spoon and fork for the dessert courses that were lain above her plate.

*So many.* Annabeth thought groggily. Desperately trying to remember which one was used for which course depending on their size. *Think dumbass. Mom spent all that money on your lessons! You better remember this!*

In the end she was able to figure it out. Realizing that she had to move left to right with her cutlery. Her mind not failing her this time thankfully.

As the minutes ticked agonizing by, Annabeth tried to listen to the conversation as she was taught to. Her mind tiredly drifting then spiking with pain at random moments. Staying quiet, even on the snippets of infuriating conversations she was hearing. Knowing that a lady didn't have a voice of opinion until she reached a certain age. So she sat there quietly as Malcolm joined in on the chipper topics.

"And there was this scrawny filthy joe sitting by my limo! And you know I never have the heart to break their days, so you know what I did? I-" Mrs. Aresto blabbered on as Annabeth pretended that her head wasn't on fire. Accepting her stewed mushroom soup and stuffed rainbow trout even though her stomach was screaming in protest to the rich foods. By the time her coq au vin was placed in front of her with steam wafting to her nose, Annabeth felt like she was about to burst. Her sleep tired head throbbing in pain as she downed each mouthful without a hint of complaint.

*Poised.* Her mind hissed. *Dumbass, it's not that hard.*

"Well I think the company's doing rather fine. Stupendous in fact compared to our rather idiotic rivals. Just the other day I was talking to-" Apollo had the luxury of being to lean back in his seat. Making Annabeth's spine cramp in protest.

She felt like crying when an unknowing butler came gracefully to her side and offered her some red wine. Catching her mother's glance and knowing that she was being watched. She nodded to the butler elegantly and watched as the sparkling crystal glass was filled with a deep red liquid.

*Spill it and you'll be twice the disappointment*. She reminded herself as she brought the glass to her painted lips to take delicate sips. The tangy flavor coating her tongue and making her mouth feel dry.

And then there were too many moments she caught Octavian's lecherous eyes raking over her figure. Ogling her shamelessly from across the table in a way that made Annabeth want to scream in hatred. She wanted to cover herself, or throw her piles of rich food in his face. By the way his lips curved into a small smug smile every time he realized he'd been caught told her that *he knew*. He knew that he made her uncomfortable and yet he made no effort to stop. Perhaps he enjoyed her discomfort in some sick manner.

"There are a certain group of individuals I feel who lack the basic IQ to vote for a stable leader. These people are obviously all amongst the lower class. Particularly bums and what not-" Octavian chattered.

A rich creamy dijon ice cream in a tall cone like glass and smothered in glossy chocolate syrup, hot swedish fudge, vibrant hand picked berries and crunchy wafer sticks was placed gingerly in front of Annabeth. Just the sight of it glistening and melting thickly in front of her was making her stomach roll dangerously. Forcing her to fight the urge to double over.

*Eat it!* Her mind growled. *Eat and be thankful!*

And she did. One bite at a time. Deliberately swallowing each painful mouthful as the conversation babbled and burbled noisily on. Each word felt like a knife to her skull. Each chink of spoons scraping glass and each loud opinion driving her past the edge. The overpoweringly sickly sweet flavours cramping her stomach even more.

"I just ADORE dancing. As does Octavian!"

"The idiot in office now has nothing against Sir Paurise Champiol. If you want a damn good prime minister, then there's your man."

"And this dame I saw on the street had the atrocity to feed her child candy as a snack! What a awful mother!"

"Malcolm has intentions of becoming a doctor. Isn't that right dear? Apollo should have good advice for you."

The words, the voices, just kept bearing down on her skull. The ice cream disappearing into her mouth as pain writhed its way around her gut like a glow worm digging through her flesh. Dizziness was overtaking her vision faster than she could fight back.

*I can't…. I'm a failure….* Her mind cried as she stood up suddenly. Breaking the conversation in a most unladylike manner when her chair screeched against the cold floor. An awkward silence startling everyone.

"Pardon me." she silkily started softly. Filling the sudden silence with her demanding presence. "But would you mind directing me to the powder room?"

Annabeth couldn't bear to look at her mother as she spoke. All knowing that she was getting the most venomous look of disappointed there ever was.

"Ah…" Mrs. Aresto paused before waving to one of the butlers. "Philips, please show Miss Chase to the powder room."

"Yes Madame." the butler stepped forward before bowing lowly. Briskly walking to the door with Annabeth following as properly as she could.

Her vision swimming in the pale creams of the room and the black figure of the formally dressed butler. Her head throbbing with every even step. Her gut feeling soiled and bubbly.

*Heel to toe. Heel to toe.* She reminded herself. Feeling the blisters already starting to form on her pinched feet. The straps cutting into her ankles. Fighting every step so she wouldn't stumble like a drunk.

"Here you are Miss." the butler waved his hand to a door just as Annabeth's gut jerked painfully. Desperately keeping her mask of pure elegance and calm grace to her face as she suffered. Managing a most strained thank you before walking into the room. Barely being able to lock the door and make it to the toilet before her dinner rose from her stomach. Streaming chunky bile puddled vomit through her mouth and splashing into the toilet water below.

The soup, the fish, the gravy pooled meat, the wine, the bread, the sides of shrimp, and the pile of ice cream all wretched from her lips in spurts of rancid smelling muck. More, more more of it squirting from her tortured stomach every time her gut clenched in discomfort. Her snow white wings buzzing then hanging limp with each roll of sickness.

Finally the waves subsided, and Annabeth was left panting as she stared disgusted and sickly into the floating contents of the toilet bowl. The stench infecting her lungs and making her gag all over again as she lay splayed beside the porcelain bowl. A dribble of vomit clinging to her chin as she weakly reached up to flush the contents down the toilet. Watching the milky brown water swirl with bits and pieces of clumpy guck as her stomach toiled and knotted again.

Tiredly, Annabeth unclasped her shoes and sighed in sweet relief as she pried them off her feet. Stiffly climbing to her full height and stumbling over to the victorian vanity sink she settled on just tiredly staring at herself through the oval embellished edge mirror. Hating her image. Hating how she had to be the actress in a costume instead of Annabeth Chase.

Hating how she had to crawl away to show weakness, or unladylike behavior. How she was forced to hide how she was truly feeling for the sake of perfection. Perfect ladies didn't have bags under their eyes, perfect ladies didn't have pudge around their midsection or a tired look in their bones. Perfect ladies didn't get sick from too much rich foods at dinner parties.

Annabeth wasn't a perfect lady. Annabeth was exactly what she saw in the mirror at that moment.

A flawed human being how could only take so much.

*Well at least vomiting made my waist look trimmer….* She observed. Standing back to look over her appearance again. Pressing a hand to her forehead when another stroke of pain zapped through it. Clouding her thoughts momentarily as she cursed silently.

*I have to get back.* She thought. *Stay in here too long and I'll look even worse.*

So, achingly Annabeth wiped the vomit from her face and reapplied her lipstick that was thankfully in her clutch. Gently she added a few gobs of soap to the toilet and flushed it several times to help get rid of the stench of fishy vomit. Finally, she put her heels back on and stood in the mirror, practicing her mask face before she was ready. In even strides she left the bathroom a perfect lady. Her stomach knotting with every step but her face a painting of young elegance and calm serenity.

Practically floating back into the dining room elegantly she witnessed the rest of the party get out of their seats. Apollo and Malcolm passing her without so much as an acknowledging glance as they talked about doctoring. Although, Malcolm did turn regretfully to shoot her a worried look as he left. A desperate cry welling in Annabeth's throat as he was led away. Her one protection against the perverted Octavian gone, leaving Annabeth with her mother, Mrs. Aresto and Octavian. Her head was still throbbing with exhaustion, but at least the grogginess seemed to have past. If only something could help the aftertaste of vomit and the swaying nausea.

"Annabeth!" Mrs. Aresto greeted sweetly. A smile in her eyes that made Annabeth's heart sink. Almost knowing what was to come. "Your Mother and I would still like to chat for a while and Malcolm and dear Apollo are getting along devilishly well. I wonder if perhaps you would like to take a stroll with Octavian on the terrace? It is a lovely night after all."

Octavian shot her a toothy grin as prickles glided down her spine. Ending in a dreaded feeling in her heart.

"I'd be delighted." Annabeth answered graciously. Taking the arm Octavian offered as she was guided toward the door. Mrs. Arestos bubbly voice haunting her back as her fingers burned on his arm.

Oh how she loathed the way he lead her like a dog. Chill and at ease with the haughty footsteps of a smug brat. Their footsteps synchronized as they stepped out onto the splendid stone terrace. Moonbeams washing the gardens with a cold blue glaze. The crickets weaving their chirping songs into the night as the soft breeze carried the smell of freshly cut grass, and past spring flowers. Soft summer air filling her lungs and faintly reducing the pain in her head. The ancient stonework of the railings was carved into curved designs, and the stone tiled ground was mosaiced into grey stone flowers and twisting vines. Surprisingly smooth and perfect in its craftsmanship.

*Is anything here not perfect?* Annabeth huffed silently to herself. Her nerves steeling when Octavian made a move to slip his arm around her waist again.

*Octavian is far from perfect.* She noted as she smoothly was able to evade his grasp by looking awed and walking over to an elevated koi pond. Pretending to be entranced by the lily laden pond and the twirling Kois. The underwater lights that illuminated the water in a fairy tale like way.

"It's beautiful." Annabeth tried for some light talking with her even tones. Walking as inconspicuously as possible to keep the pond between them.

"As are you." Octavian smiled. If it were a genuine smile, she couldn't tell. He had this crazy twinkle in his eye as if he were thinking of some great secret. A shudder worked its way down Annabeth's spine when his eyes grazed over her figure again.

"Thank-you." Annabeth spoke smoothly although she was burning with disgust. Not being able to help the flush of anger rising to her face at his ways. "There is more to a woman than beauty however." she found herself saying with an edge of protest to his advances.

"Of course there is." Octavian gave her a shock of surprise when he agreed to her. "And I do say you surpass in every way a women should be a women."

Curiosity nipped at, Annabeth slightly tilted her head in his direction. "How so?" she questioned while folding her hands in front of her. Fighting the sharp aches of her mind.

Octavian sat on the side of the pond. Eyes gleaming as he watched her with that unnerving gaze. "Well, I hear you are quite the academic achiever. That is very amiable trait. I believe a woman should be smart and well educated to help her future partner. Behind every successful man there is a woman. But that's not all, a woman should be poised, calm and little spoken as you are. Being a perfect host helps a household and calm women makes for a wonderful *mother*."

Annabeth held back a gag at the word *mother*.

She? Be a good mother thanks to her calmness?

*I daresay that's the falsest thing I've ever heard.* Annabeth swallowed the words. Her own mother's calm way of dealing with her flickering at the back of her mind like acid. How she could stay so wonderfully calm while putting Annabeth down.

*Not to mention everything Octavian finds ideal in a woman is just an accessory to a man.*

"Should a woman have a career?" Annabeth asked with fake dubiousness. Acting dumb so he wouldn't find the contempt in her.

"Only if they are unfortunate enough to not find a hardworking husband. Or if their husband perish's too early as is the condition your poor mother found herself in." Octavian's eyes weren't leaving her. Why wouldn't he just look away?

A shameless silence followed as Annabeth opted not to say a thing. Staring back at him as intensely as he was gazing at her. Trying to deter his eyes. Trying to keep him away.

It didn't work. In fact it had the opposite effect intended.

Octavian rose to his feet and made his way towards her. Gaze locked in a way that forced Annabeth to look at the ground as he approached. A suffocated feeling grabbing onto her throat with each step. Knowing that she couldn't step away without making it obvious that she despised his presence. If he was offended by her actions than there was no doubt her mother would find out. Most likely resulting in Annabeth being shunned by her own mother.

"You've got such beautiful eyes." he breathed hotly when he was a step away. His presence hard to ignore.

"Thank you." Annabeth murmured. Not daring to look up at him as she stared at her shoes. Her empty stomach rolling with bile all over again.

"I can't help but fall a little for you every time we meet."

Annabeth's heart dropped. A panicked sensation sweeping over skin as her chin was forced up to be face to face with Octavian. His creepy smile back on and in full creep mode. His eyes glinting like that of a proud cat.

So different from Percy's wily but warm looks. So different.

"You're alluring in many ways Annabeth Chase." he muttered with a tone in his voice that she didn't like. His eyes scanning over her face as if he were admiring himself in the reflection of a trophy. His humid breath making her internally recoil with every passing second.

"That says something considering we've only met twice." Annabeth blurted out suddenly when Octavian made a move to kiss her. Her heart leaping in fear at his closeness before he took a step back to raise an amused eyebrow at her.

"Well, I suppose you just have that effect on me."

"I see." Annabeth couldn't help but lightly sigh when he moved away. The pressure of his presence relieved once more. The obvious silence between them was buffered by the low whistle of wind in the trees. The light casting from the koi pond flickering as one of the playful fish disturbed the waters surface.

Annabeth shook her nerves and tried to be content with just staring out onto the acres and of gardens and lawn. Shadows from the moon's touch stretching across the ground in a ghostly way.

*I wonder if Percy is alright… If he hasn't eaten something I might just kill him...*

"Does my family name remind you of anything?" Octavian suddenly asked with pride already in his voice. Strolling back over to her casually with a dimpled look of pleasure on his face.

Irritation rose to Annabeth's mouth as he proceeded to stand very close beside her. Leaving her with hardly any thinking space, or personal space.

Nevertheless, Annabeth persevered and wracked her groggy mind. Flicking through her memory at a sluggish pace.

"I believe there was a relatively recent Prime Minister who held the name Aresto." Annabeth answered. Not giving Octavian the slightest glance in fear that he would take it as an invitation to come closer.

"That's right." Octavian grinned devilishly proud. "He was my grandfather. Prime Minister Claudius Aresto. He bought this estate actually, and used it as his hunting lodge when most of the surrounding area was game wood instead of farm."

"This is quite a big hunting lodge." Annabeth commented lightly. Wishing that she could go home already. That she could flop into bed and sleep her worries away.

"It is." Octavian agreed. "I find I might be rather lonely here when my parents leave."

This bubbled a few questions to Annabeth's mind as she finally turned to look at him in perplexity.

"You are not returning to the city?" she inquired as ladylike as possible. A part of her withering with the prospect of Octavian constantly living a few miles away.

"No." Octavian answered simply. Smile broadening on his face. "As training to take over my father's position he's going to send me his paperwork. A horrendously taxing job, but a crucial one if I am to learn the ways of his business. As a gift, Dad passed me on this old house. My parents are only here to make sure my move goes smoothly, and to take care of a few remaining matters."

Annabeth bit back any remark she had on being a snobby rich kid. How he presented his move into a grand million dollar estate as if he were merely switching apartments infuriated her. His entire lack of graciousness towards the money he possessed showed a very flawed personality, and character.

"Well I hope you enjoy it here." Annabeth said instead. Keeping her mask on and her figure in a perfectly straight line. Her tones as even and as sweet as ever.

Octavian smiled broadly at her. His perfect white teeth flashing for a moment. "Well, I will be counting on visits from you if I may confess."

*Please don't confess.*

"I shall be heading off to University in the fall." Annabeth laid down an excuse seamlessly. "Any visits I make shall be limited to the summer I'm afraid."

"Well." Octavian smirked. "I very much hope that will change."

-{:oOo:}-

Octavian showed her around the gardens after that. Not a moment passed when Annabeth didn't have to find some way to fight off his hands and looks. He took her to the stables, and kennels and then proceeded to show her to the state of the art ballroom where he tried to persuade her to dance with him.

Annabeth was more than grateful to have left that awful place. Nearly falling asleep in the limo ride home as her tied bones cried in relief at being just seated. By the time they were walking back into the house, Annabeth was droopy and utterly exhausted. Ready to peel back the folds of her bed and sink into a deep sleep.

But before she could even make it up the stairway she was stopped by a stern voice and a cold glare. Malcolm nowhere in sight to save her from this.

"Annabeth." her mother nearly hissed. Shivers winding there way down Annabeth's spine as she turned around to face her mother. The comforting droopiness of sleep stripped from her bones as her heart started beating relentlessly in her chest.

"We should discuss the way you conducted yourself during dinner." Athena spoke lowly. Eyes as sharp as knives. Her figure looking threatening in the dimly lit front hall.

"Yes mother." Annabeth tried to keep her voice from quavering. Her gut skittering in fear and shame.

"You understand which situation I am referring to." Athena took a step towards her. Eyes slitted dangerously a voice sharp with a cool anger.

"When I left for the powder room." Annabeth whispered in shame. Recalling the moment she suddenly took to her feet. Her chair rudely squeaking against the floor and interrupting the rest of the merry conversation.

Annabeth fought back the tears, and pulled her mask on tight. Keeping her features calm and unemotional lest her mother chastise her for crying like a baby.

"A lady does not demand her presence to be known for such a trivial favor as asking to be guided to the powder room!" her mother's tone was filled with condescending disappointment. Her eyes frigid with disapproval and her figure tight in contempt. "I was most humiliated by your act of selfishness."

Annabeth's heart squeezed painfully as she clenched her fists behind her back. Trying desperately to keep her wings from drooping. "Apologies Mother." she muttered. "I was not feeling well at the time."

"And now you have the audacity to conjure excuses for yourself! Have you no shame?" Athena turned away in anger. Annabeth was left to look at her tense shoulders and straight back. Her neatly tucked grey tipped wings without a feather out of line. Sadness latching onto her like a coiling snake as she saw her mother's tenseness fall into a defeated state.

"Everything I do." Athena began somberly. "Is for the security of your future. I've never hesitated to spend money on your upbringing. I've sent you to the best schools, and hired only the best manner tutors who demanded money I was struggling to make. Yet still you shame me. I don't know what else to do with you Annabeth. Everyday you mortify me with your unchecked behavior. Can't you conduct yourself correctly for once in your life? If not for your own sake then for mine?"

Annabeth bit her lip to keep it from trembling. Her hands shaking terribly as her mask was melting away. She could only be thankful that her mother wasn't facing her to see her falling apart.

"I'll try mother." she managed to get out decently. Wanting more than anything for her Mother to just accept her. To celebrate who she is, and not to mellow in who she wasn't.

"You haven't tried very hard thus far." Athena muttered under her breath in a broken way. A heaviness in her voice as she turned to walk to her office. "You are dismissed."

Annabeth was left gaping. Burning tears ready to fly down her face as she stood there shattered.

*I have tried!* She wanted to cry. *I always try!*

Instead she crawled up the stairs steadily. Curling around the banister and barely making to her room before the mask broke. Crumbling, Annabeth sunk down behind the door in her room. Clasping a hand to her lips as her mother's words echoed and taunted her over and over again. Her failures dancing infront of her eyes in the darkness of her room. Muffling her sobs miserably against her vibrating fingers as shudders of breaths heaved past her lips as quietly as possible. The long held in tears burned tracks in her cheeks as the fell, cutting through her perfect makeup. Darkening her perfect dress in ugly blots. Ruining her perfect image.

She hated perfect.

She loathed it.

Because she could never be it. She could only pretend like a penniless actress pretended to be a wealthy duchess. How could you become something you're not?

Seconds twisted into minutes as Annabeth hiccuped and shuddered against the door. Sourly familiar with the taste of her own tears and the haunting emptiness of her own room. How her repressed sobs made her throat ache and nose runny was also not unknown.

She almost just straight up crawled into bed. Not ready to deal with her own stupid reflection in the mirror that told her how pathetic she looked. But she refrained. Recalling all those sleepless nights filled with disappointed words that would poke her awake. Each time she drifted off 'failure' was eerily whispered into her ear as if death was crouching on her bedside gleefully.

*I'm such a cry baby.* Annabeth seethed at herself suddenly. Vigorously wiping her eyes dry as she became angry with herself. *Women up. Do something useful. Visit Percy or something.*

Annabeth paused. Listening to the night cold of noise. Deciding on her next actions.

*Ya, I better check on Percy.*
