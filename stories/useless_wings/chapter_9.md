### Chapter 9
Annabeth pulled her bike to the side of the street and dipped into a shady alley. Falling under the cloak of darkness as she whipped her phone out of her sweatpant pocket.

Quietly, she pressed the button to call Piper and waited patiently as the phone rang. The even tones telling her it was ringing murmuring in her ear for a brief second.

"Annabeth! How was it? Did you have fun?" Piper's chirpy voice almost instantly came over the line.

"Pipes, I have a favor." Annabeth whispered hoarsely. Not wanting to be heard by any potential passerby.

"Name your request." Piper's voice fell into a concerned quizzical mix. Not sure of what to make of Annabeth's unexpectedly serious demeanor.

"I told Mother that I'd be spending the night at your place. She thinks I'm heading to your house now. If she so happens to call, could you tell her I'm there? Okay?" Annabeth explained as she looked up to the crack of sky between two buildings. The black void with no stars staring back at her.

"Where are you going?" Piper asked curiously.

"I'll tell you later okay?" Annabeth answered nervously. Trying to think up an answer. "I don't know how long this is gonna take, so can I count on you to cover for me?"

"Consider this mission a success." Piper barked in her best sergeant voice. Probably saluting like an idiot, alone in the middle of her room.

"Also, could I crash at your house once I'm done? I promise I'll crawl through your window as quick as a mouse." Annabeth breathed deeply. "You don't even have to wait up for me or anything."

A long silence followed before Piper hummed in a perplexed tone. "Okie doke. But you have to relay exactly what you're up to Miss."

"Thanks Pipes. This means the world." Annabeth sighed. Relief flooding her burdened shoulders.

And before Pipes could ask anymore questions, Annabeth hung up. Feeling a little guilty that she didn't have an explanation but knowing that Piper had her back no matter what.

Pushing off the pavement, she directed the bike down the hill. Passing under streetlights and zooming passed people walking in the darkness. Her heavy shoulder bag thumping against her side as she petaled, and her wings drinking in the wind. Each time she paused her pedals the chains would click as the bike coasted.

Curving off the road, she turned her bike out of the artificial light onto the lane that lead into the green strip. Darkness enfolding her as shadows guided where the tree line was. Whistling lightly to herself as she worked the bike around the bend. Each vigorous pedal propelling her faster towards Percy.

Suddenly, she came face to face with a shadow standing in the middle of the road. His head craned upwards towards the forest as he moved funny looking binoculars around. Annabeth hit the brakes and gave a shrill cry of a warning. Her wings flapping in alarm against her back.

"Watch it!" he jerked away from her as to avoid getting hit. Her bike screeching to a stop beside him.

"Sorry." she gasped. "But you really shouldn't be in the middle of the road."

She could barely see him through the darkness. The only thing she could note was that he was of bigger build, and was holding a peculiar something that she had mistaken for binoculars.

"James! Lights!" he barked as if commanding an order.

Instantly Annabeth was engulfed in blinding white lights streaming by the side of the road. Throwing up an arm she tried to squint through blazes of white pure light but failed epically.

"Whoa! What the bloody hell?" she growled angrily. "Shut those bloody things off, what in the daylights are you damned folks trying to do? Blind me?"

In a second the lights turned down and Annabeth peeked beneath her arm to stare at the idiots who caused the hassle in the first place.

"You've got quite the dirty mouth on ya for being so young." The man beside her bike huffed. Her eyes finally adjusting so she could see his hawk nose and pointed features. The way he was scowling with his lip turned down in an ugly manner.

"You'd have the mouth of a scallying pirate too if you were suddenly popped into blazes of obnoxious light after a casual ride in the dark. Is it not hard to believe that when a bloke stands in the middle of the bloody road and almost throws me off my damned bike then almost blinds me pisses the fricken daylights outta me?"

"One would question why a little girl was riding a bike towards the woods in the middle of the night in the first place." The man spat back.

Annabeth's eyebrows dipped as she looked him over once more.

How his shoulder was slightly hunched to one side, and the way his eyes followed her every movement as if he were preparing for her to attack.

Then there were the goggles in his hands. Not just any goggles, but state of the art night vision goggles. His fingers curled harshly around the edges with an unnatural amount of tension. Almost as if he were scared to lose them.

"I have a right to be here don't I?" Annabeth stuck her nose in the air stubbornly. Casually turning her attention over to the vehicle parked on the side of the road. The powerful lights strapped to its top.

She smelt something fishy when she saw the men piled in the back of the green jeep. One loose rifle carelessly left in her line of sight. She predicted they each had one with the way there backs were so straight. No one sat like a perfect english lady unless they had a pole like object pressed to there back.

'*People in jeeps and helicopters came out of nowhere. We tried to escape…*' Annabeth's blood ran cold as she made the connections. Her head spinning as she realized exactly what they were looking for in the forest at this time of night.

But Annabeth was a master of the mask. She never let her fear show, and she'd be damned if she did it now.

"You boys really shouldn't be hunting this time of year." She glowered in her most menacing way. "Schools almost out and teens are throwing bush parties all over these parts."

It wasn't exactly a lie. Annabeth had overheard some girls at her school chattering and squealing over prime campfire areas.

"Is that where you're going?" The man raised an eyebrow at her mockingly. "A little bush party?"

"None of your beeswax." She growled. Anger throbbing through her veins.

"You've got spunk for such a little girl." The man sniffed. Shifted back onto the weight of his heels as he looked at her through gleaming eyes. Looking her over as if she were just a piece of meat. Shadows criss crossing across his face in an ugly tangle of lines.

"Dare you change the subject?" she huffed indignantly. "You're hunting in an area at night where teens are potentially partying. Do you know how dangerous that is? One foul bullet is all it takes before you're locked up for a lifetime."

The guys in the jeep shifted uncomfortably for a moment. None of them wearing anything notable. No logos, or symbols to announce they were from any agency. Just regular street clothes.

Chances were, they were operating without informing the local police if they were part of some government branch. Why the government would hunt a person who knew how to fly was beyond her.

*Maybe they just like slaying people who learn how to fly…. But how has this secret been contained?*

"Just get lost." he spat as he turned back towards the jeep. Obviously done with the conversation.

"Fine." Annabeth gritted while her white wings buzzed irritably. Edging her bike forward before she pedaled away. Very aware of a few wary glances being thrown in her direction.

Miffed, she pedaled onward. Speeding around the curve and letting her curls fly. When she was a satisfactory distance away she wiggled her phone out of her pocket and dialed for the police.

*Doesn't matter who they are.* She reminded herself. *Telling the police about them will definitely put their search for Percy on hold, for at least tonight.*

After her brief phone call, she went on her merry way. Nothing of consequence breaking her path as she chained her bike and started lugging her bag through the bramble thick forest. Cursing horrendously whenever she got snagged on a branch or fell over a log in the darkness. Feeling her way past trunks of trees with only the slimmest trace of moonlight to guide her. Truth be told she had a flashlight in her backpack but she didn't dare turn it on in case she'd been followed by those awful people in the jeep. She couldn't risk it at least.

Either way Annabeth finally felt the familiar rugged bark of Percy's tree. Barely being able to see the outline of his raw little treehouse.

*At this rate, I'll be as strong as an ox.* Annabeth thought begrudgingly as she hefted herself up the tree. Her forearms burning from all the extra weight.

Exhausted she rolled into the safety of the tree house breathing heavily as her thighs prickled in protest. The rough bark of the lumpy floor digging into her back as she huffed, and stared at the jumbled dark ceiling.

*Strange how the fires not lit.* Annabeth noticed with a hint of perplexion. Tilting her head towards the pit, and the seemingly empty treehouse.

*Where's Percy?!* Annabeth jumped to her feet in alarm. Scanning the eerily dark room while the wind creaked against the wood. Her eyes following the beams of wood on the floor, until they settled on a lump where the sleeping bag usually was kept.

With a heavy sigh of relief, Annabeth let her shoulder bag drop to the floor. The contents clanging noisily as she stepped gingerly across the rugged log floor towards the makeshift 'bed'.

"Percy." Annabeth called, trying to wake him. "I brought food."

He didn't answer.

"Percy?" Annabeth unzipped the sleeping bag and peeled back the cover. A stab of dismay taking over her as she saw his wings wrapped tightly around his body and trembling. A thick sheen of sweat encasing his face as he twisted over to glower at her blearily. She pointedly ignored the bundle of fur beside Percy as it hissed in annoyance. Bandit giving her the dirtiest look she's gotten yet before tumbling out of the bag and marching towards the door to start her night time adventures.

"Is cold." he burbled while gripping at the covers again. Another tremble shuttering his wings.

"Percy, are you alright?" Annabeth gasped as she fell beside him. Noticing the shivers coursing through his body buried in the sleeping bag.

"Mmh fine." he mumbled while scrunching his face up as if he were concentrating really hard. His hood pulled over his head to retain heat. "Just cold."

Pushing his midnight locks off his forehead, Annabeth pressed her palm to his skin. Her heart plummeting at how it felt.

"You're burning up!" she hissed. Pulling her hand away as Percy cracked his eyes open to glare lightly at her. As if he wanted to pretend that she hadn't said a thing.

"Mmh fine." he uttered again while twisting away from her. Another spasm of shivers echoing through his figure. His body curling tighter into a fetal position.

Annabeth fell back on her heels and looked him over. Concern panging around her heart.

*I might as well start the fire before I do anything.* She decided. Getting to her feet and gathering what she needed. In a few minutes, feeling satisfied at the lively flame she created.

*Now back to business...*

"Come on Percy, get up." Annabeth urged gently. "Let me see your back."

Begrudgingly Percy sat up and cumbersomely turned his back to see her. Not having the energy to even argue as he slouched tiredly. With a flick of her hands to unbuttoned his hoodie wing straps. Tugging delicately at the sweater yank it off.

"Arms up." Annabeth instructed. Peeling the sweater away from his body when he obliged. She repeated the steps for his shirt until she could finally inspect his stitched up wound.

With quick and steady hands, Annabeth peeled the bandages away. Her gut knotting as a bad smell was released with each bind. The last layer revealed a mess of chili red inflamed skin that bulged around the stitches. The tense area was hotter than his face, and the skin tight and blood red.

"Bloody hell." Annabeth cursed as she looked it over again. "Perce? How does it feel?"

"My back burns…" Percy slurred. "But is weird because I'm… cold?"

Percy was in fact the opposite of cold. Annabeth could tell by just looking at him. Sweat was just glinting off his body as if he had just taken a shower. His hair spiked with moisture, and his shoulders beading with it. He didn't look good at all.

Annabeth swallowed her fear and stood bravely. Retrieving her bag and lugging it over to Percy with labored steps. The bottom of her bag scuffing against the raw wood floor.

"I'm going to clean your back again. Okay?" Annabeth warned as she brought out the alcohol wipes. Peeling the packaging off one before Percy had time to nod and pressing it against his throbbing wound.

Percy's wings shuddered and twitched, but he was able to not cover his wound like a dog hiding it's paw. His fisted hands fell loose when Annabeth finished wiping and he let out a guttural sound of relief. No words passing between them as Annabeth silently wrapped him in fresh bandages. The cotton plush on her fingers as she listened carefully to the lulling wind in the trees, and cracks in the fire. Subconsciously listening for any men in jeeps.

"Hold on." Annabeth held him back from putting his shirt back on. His eager hands thumbing the material. "You're covered in sweat."

"No Im not." Percy stated groggily while swinging his head towards her. His enchanting eyes squinting in the firelight. A lost haze glazing his eyes.

"Yes you are." Annabeth corrected. Digging her water bottle out of her bag and squirting a bit of water onto one of the wipes to dilute the alcohol.

Squeezing it out, she dumped a bit more water on it, then plopped it onto his back. Percy mumbled in protest like a sulking child but she persevered. Cleaning him up until he wasn't a sticky mess.

"Here." Annabeth muttered, as she took away his sweaty shirt and hoodie. Dropping them in a pile before digging through the bag of clothes she had only brought him the day before. Picking out another pair of clean clothes and passing them too him. Trying not to feel guilty that she had deliberately pulled out the panda hoodie.

*It's the thickest one* she convinced herself. *It's the best choice for him to wear now.*

Percy ended up needing help with slipping the clothes on. His strength being so low he seemed to get tired by just trying to pull a shirt on.

"Have you eaten anything today Percy?" Annabeth asked quietly as she pulled the hoodie with the little ears over his head. Helping his arms slipped through the sleeves before buttoning up the wing holes.

"I ate…. I ate…." Percy mumbled blearily. "I ate… I… I wasn't hungry."

"Nevermind." Annabeth let it slide. "Here, just drink this. Okay? You need water." Annabeth pressed the water bottle into his hands. Making sure he drank at least half of it before letting him slip back under the warm covers of his sleeping bag.

Half an hour later she was back by his side, with half a pot of stew heated over the fire. Thankful that her family's leftovers were so protien packed.

"Perce." Annabeth shook him lightly with her free hand. "Percy I brought food."

"Not hungry." he mumbled into the sleeping bag. Dismay strangling Annabeth again when she saw the buildup of sweat on his forehead again.

"Please?" Annabeth choked.

*He has to eat. He has to eat. If he doesn't eat, he can't get better.*

"No."

"Percy Please? It's beef stew. It's still hot. It'll make you feel better. I promise." Annabeth tried to bait him. Her heart skittering in her chest. "Just sit up okay?"

"But Im not-"

"Percy." Annabeth begged this time. "Just a few bites. It'll help you. You haven't eaten all day."

"But-"

"Percy, please."

"...fine." Percy surrendered sleepily as he struggled out of his sleeping bag again. His wings limp and drooping out of his lack of energy. Carelessly taking the pot and the spoon and queasily bringing a drippy biteful to his mouth.

"You're getting it everywhere." Annabeth pointed out. Taking his wrist and guiding his hand. Determination firing in her gut that he would make it through this. That she wouldn't let him get any worse.

Dishearteningly, Percy pushed the pot back at her after a painful swallow. His eyes already slouching closed as his body seemed to be aching for sleep.

"Percy, you need at least a few more bites." Annabeth persisted. Trying to keep the concern in her under wraps.

*I can't take him to a hospital. Either he gets better, or worse. I can't do anything else.*

"Too tired." he grumbled. Shifting backwards as if to fall into his sleeping bag again. The measly moth holed material somehow looking appealing to Percy.

Annabeth set a hand on his slouched shoulders and kept him upright. Her eyes burning and her heart hammering. "Here." she breathed as she set the pot in her lap and took up the spoon in her free hand. "I can feed it to you."

Percy muttered a few inaudible words but nothing of worth noting. He didn't object as she helped him eat.

Packing as much as she could onto each spoonful and watching him as he chewed drearily slow. His eyes half lidded yet curious as he stared blankly at her. Each passing moment, each empty spoonful, he just watched with eyes that ate away at her fraying nerves. The flimsy light from the fire stretching and shrinking like an elastic band. The orange glow deepening the rooms rustic look.

"What?" she finally asked between spoonfuls.

"Why are you helping me?" Percy managed to say through a mouthful of stew. His head cocking slightly to the side as he spoke lazily slow. "You… you don't need to."

Annabeth snorted lightly and held out another spoonful to Percy patiently. "You're right. I don't need to. I want to. I'm not going to leave you sick and alone in the middle of the woods. Now eat up. The more you eat, the better."

Percy grunted a reply and took another sloppy mouthful. Slowly working his way through the pot until Annabeth was scraping the bottom. Her worries that were eating through her gut, slowly dissolving as she thought the situation through more clearly.

*It could get worse.* She reminded herself. *But it could get better.*

"Now you can sleep." Annabeth sighed. Feeling the stress of weariness bear down on her own bones. How her shoulders cramped and legs burned from sitting in the same position for so long.

Percy yawned heavily before shifting and scooting back into his sleeping bag. His wings curling around himself like another blanket. Mumbling a few more things before he started drifting away. An instant later he was snoring steadily with his mouth slightly ajar and his hood falling away from his face. The cute round panda ear on that side flopping backwards.

*He's just like a little kid.* Annabeth chuckled inwardly as she set the pot down beside her. A ghost smile on her face. *He's cute.*

Shifting into a more comfortable sitting position, Annabeth leaned back leisurely. Her thoughts shifting on what she should do next. To leave or to stay. Wondering if Percy would be alright for the rest of the night.

*Better stay.* She determined. *Everything could get dreadfully worse if I haven't treated that infection correctly… Percy could die… then he'd never get home. But then again, he isn't returning home anytime soon. His mother is probably missing him terribly...*

*I wonder what his mother's like. Perhaps she has a hand on how he discovered flying. And the whereabouts of Percy's father? Hopefully Percy's mother has someone to confide in while she's facing this loss. Hopefully Percy will get back to her!*

*But how?*

*How will Percy get out of this mess without being killed?*

Annabeth looked back at Percy's sleeping figure. His hair falling slightly over his eyebrows messily and a trail of drool sparkling in the warm firelight. How his deep worry lines were eased away in the peacefulness of sleep. Annabeth chuckled somewhat fondly and brushed the hair away from his face. A ball of warmth expanding in her chest.

*I have to help him somehow….. But how?*

-{:oOo:}-

Annabeth was wretched from sleep in a second. Her heart instantly hammering in her chest and her eyes wide and alert as someone scrambled over her. The smell of smoke invading her lungs with each heavily labored breath. When her eyes focused she was alarmed to see filaments of soot dancing fluidly through the air that made her wings buzz in fright. Heat pressing against her back like an unseen force as her own shadow loomed and danced in front of her eyes amongst waves of warm light.

When Annabeth stumbled around, her heart leapt wildly into her throat at the orange flames leaking from the fire. Catching and dancing on the log floor and taunting in foot high walls at Percy as he beat it with an old sweater. Flickering and bowing over and over in a unrequited performance as it spat heat and light and plumes of dark smoke.

Desperately, Annabeth grabbed at her water bottle. Tightening her grip on the metallic edges and fumbling with the fickle plastic knob. The miniscule amount of water inside of it sloshing and swishing against the sides, reminding her of how empty it was.

Shakily she emptied the water onto a shirt lying on the floor and attacked the flames. Slapping them down inch by inch until even the fire within the ring of rocks had been extinguished. Leaving a long black scar arching from the pit to the wall. Dying embers burning brightly in the sudden darkness as they faded into nothing. Then pitch black invaded, and took over, forcing Annabeth to grab at her bag again and feel around until she felt the cold metal of her flashlight. In a quick rubber button press, there was a bright white light that flooded them in heatless comfort. Chasing the shadows and easing the fear.

Annabeth's heart was still fluttering in unplanned beats. Her throat felt thick and her eyes were burning from smoke. Her wings were flapping uncontrollably with each tense second that passed. Her gut swelled with guilt as she looked at Percy with teary eyes.

"Bloody hell, I fell asleep." she gasped, gripping the flashlight in both hands. "I'm so sorry. I fell asleep and I didn't put the fire out and- and I almost killed both of us.. I- I just. Bloody idiot. That's what I am. I'm a-"

Percy's knees buckled and he plummeted forward. Annabeth catching him as fast as she could as she let the flashlight clatter to the floor. Her adrenaline heavy system reacting quicker than she ever would on a normal day.

"Mh sorry." he muttered against her shoulder. Struggling to stand as he flapped his wings lightly to gain some balance. "Lightheaded… I got up a bit fast."

"If you didn't we could've died." Annabeth trembled. Biting her lip to keep it from quivering. Her eyes filling fast with tears. "I'm so sorry. I drifted off. I'm- I'm sorry."

She was fighting the tears as hard she could but they just squeezed out. Dripping down her face as she helped Percy back to his sleeping bag.

"It's okay." he muttered. Hunching into a limp sit.

"No it's not." Annabeth choked. "No it's not, I almost killed us. I could've killed you. I-"

Unexpectedly, Percy gently grabbed her hand. His burning fingers tightening around hers as he locked eyes. Sincerity ringing deep within the depths of his deep forest green eyes.

"We're both alive." He reminded her softly. Eyes never wavering. "We're fine. It's okay."

In a wave of unwilling relief, Annabeth's shoulders fell. Her heart pumping in her chest as her cheeks started to burn.

"Okay." she whispered. Trying to shake the tremors of fear from her body. "Alright."

"You feeling better?" she changed the subject while drying her tears. Slipping her hand out of Percy's to feel his forehead with her palm again. Still feeling hot and clammy. Still looking like he could collapse in a second.

"A bit." he replied hoarsely while scratching the back of his neck. Staring at her unblinkingly. His eyes soft yet questioning. At least he seemed to have a bit more energy.

"Why are you still here? And what time is it?" Percy finally looked into his lap. Threading his fingers together somberly as Annabeth slipped her phone out of her sweatpants pocket.

"Its 3:34 in the morning." She answered quietly as she squinted at the screen light. "I decided to stay, incase you needed any other assistance…. But I suppose leaving would've been the wiser option…"

"Why was there even a choice?" Percy tilted his head at her in a perplexed way. His tone weary but determined. "You should've gone home. You should've gotten some sleep."

"I couldn't just leave you!" Annabeth argued.

"Why not?" Percy was still exhausted, that much was clear in his voice. And yet he persisted, and asked. Digging for answers she hadn't even thought of yet all while keeping his steady eyes locked on hers.

"Because I care about you." She muttered. Feeling the truthfulness of her own words hit her in the face. "You're not just some bonkers fellow in the woods I arbitrary visit out of sick curiosity. You're my friend in my books. I want to help you."

A grateful yet pursed smile tugged its way onto Percy's lips. His eyes falling to his hands. "I think you're a friend too." he uttered quietly. Almost as if he were afraid to say it.

"I would hope so." Annabeth chuckled delicately before a timid silence stated its place. Leaving room for them to listen to the hush of the trees outside and the eerie call of a faraway coyote. The flashlight casting long shadows from its place on the floor, and boldly defining the features on their faces.

"You should sleep." Annabeth suggested. "You've still got a raging fever."

"You should too." Percy mumbled as he starting slipping back under the covers. "Everyone needs sleep."

Annabeth was about to respond when Percy held up the sleeping bag flap apparently for her. His gaze locking onto hers again as he spoke his offer through his eyes.

"Sleep here?!" Annabeth exclaimed in shock.

It was tempting though. Just to let go and fall into the folds of sleep. Relieve her bagging eyes and stiff back.

Percy shrugged like it didn't matter. "It's really dark outside. I doubt you'd be able to find your way out of the forest. Plus it doesn't make sense for you to sleep on those logs."

*What would mother think?! She'd be infuriated! I'd probably be kicked out!* Annabeth groaned and rubbed the knot in her neck. Her inner battles breaking through.

*But mother's not here. Plus I need sleep if I'm ever going to make the school day productive tomorrow...* Finally breaking, Annabeth caved and crawled in beside Percy. Her arms sore and stiff from hitting the fire out and her back feeling like it was rusting to pieces. The dry leaves under the sleeping bag rustled and crunched beneath her until she settled right next to Percy on her side. Realizing just how uncomfortable it was with nothing by dry leaves between you and some logs. But Annabeth bit down on any complaint that would rise to her mouth.

*Percy sleeps like this every night.* She reminded herself. *Don't you dare complain.*

Suddenly Percy shifted and Annabeth felt a tickling sensation as he extended one midnight wing and wrapped it around her. His soft feathers acting as an extra layer of warmth that sent tingles down her spine.

*No personal space.* Annabeth noted with a blush blooming on her face. *But he's been alone for a year. He's forgotten plenty of things. Besides, we're in a sleeping bag, how much personal space can I have anyways?*

"Percy?" Annabeth shifted over to face him. Her eyes wide as she came nose to nose with his face.

Percy didn't crack an eyelid open. "Yea?" he mumbled in a doze.

"Promise you'll tell me if you need anything. Okay?" She whispered. Tentatively brushing his locks away from his forehead to check his temperature one last time.

*Still feels like he's on fire.*

"Okay." Percy muttered with a slur. Drifting off faster than ever. Leaving Annabeth to just watch him float away into dreamworld.

Her own eyes growing heavy, and the warmth sinking into her body didn't help her alertness.

Soon, she too had drifted off.

-{:oOo:}-

Annabeth woke up the moment light skimmed the farthest reaches of the horizon in dazzling pinks and purples. She woke up, not from the beautiful birds calling and singing amongst the fresh summer trees, but because a smelly cranky raccoon was crawling, and clawing over her face to get inside the sleeping bag. Hissing and spitting as she crawled under the flap of the sleeping bag. When she was awake enough to figure out her location she found that embarrassingly enough, she was smoshed right in beside Percy, both his wings around her now as they lay cuddled together.

Brushing aside the voice in her head screaming at how indecent it was, Annabeth checked Percy's temperature with the back of her hand. Sighing in relief when she realized that his fever had broken.

Getting out of the tangle of wings, arms, and fabric proved to be difficult. But once she was free, she realized just how badly she wanted to crawl back in and sleep. How she felt twice as tired as yesterday, and how her muscles ached from sleeping on such a hard surface.

However, the next hour was nothing but exhausting work for Annabeth by first getting dressed in her crumpled school uniform, then hiking through the woods to her bike, then biking to the nearest 24 hour superstore, then buying Percy a day's worth of food before lugging it back through the forest and up to the tree.

She had to make several trips up and down the prickly branches in order for it all to get in the little treehouse. The jug of water being the most challenging of them all.

In the end she looked a mess, and smelled like sweat and dirt. Percy on the other hand hadn't even woken up yet. His hair flying everywhere as he lay splayed out in the bag. Snoring peacefully away in his panda hoodie, in a way Annabeth didn't dare disturb him. He needed his sleep. Bandit in the meantime was hissing a growling up a storm at her for no apparently reason.

*Stupid Raccoon.* Annabeth sniffed as she organised the food and hoped that the little monster didn't steal any of it.

By the time she looked at her clock again, her heart seemed to wither in her chest. It was time for school.

*How marvelous.* She thought sourly while dragging her bike towards the school. Her curls a knotted mess and her wings unpreened and in disarray. If she looked down she would noticed that she hadn't tied her tie right, and that her blouse was untucked and flapping in the crisp breeze that hit her lungs.

*But Percy's okay…* Her mind sighed. A sense of warm gratitude in her chest besides all the pain and exhaustion she was facing. That one flicker of warmth seemingly worth it for all her troubles.

"ANNABETH!" a shrill cry came echoing over the street. Bouncing off the houses and making Annabeth cringe.

A second later Piper pounced onto her best friend and tackled her to the ground. The bike clattering to the pavement noisily as Annabeth cringe from all the noise. Her tired brain functioning so slowly.

"Where were you!" Piper nearly shrieked. Shaking Annabeth's shoulders roughly. "I was worried sick! You never showed last night! I was panicking this morning!"

"Pipes, chill." Annabeth groaned while pushing her away and climbing to her feet. No patience left in her voice, and no sympathy in her hands.

"Annabeth!?" Piper cried in shock as she lay on the sidewalk. "What's gotten into you?!"

Breathing deeply, Annabeth put out a hand to help Piper up. Apologies swirling around her baggy eyes as she helped the brunette to her feet.

"Nothin Pipes. Sorry, I just barely slept last night." Annabeth answered sluggishly as she made a move for her bike. Guilt written on her features.

Piper tilted it back upright before Annabeth had a chance to protest. "Golly, you're right. You look terrible! What were you even doing all night?"

*An excuse… what can I tell her that she'd believe?*

Fumbling with her shoulder bag, Annabeth produced her gold compass and showed it to Piper. Flashing it in front of her eyes for a second before saying. "Lost this in the Green Strip, then got lost in the woods because it was so dark. Ended up falling asleep under a tree."

"You slept in the Green?" Piper gasped in horror. "Annabeth! Don't you realize how dangerous that was?"

"Not dangerous enough to kill me." Annabeth muttered groggily while rubbing her eyes. A yawn escaping her lips before she had a chance to cover it.

She could barely see two feet in front of her. The light seemed way too bright and all those obnoxious birds singing! Seriously, she just wanted to curl up in bed and sleep for eons.

"I'll take the notes for you if you wish." Piper promised sweetly. "So you can catch a tad of shut eye then I suppose."

"Thanks Pipes. But I'd rather sleep at home. If my grades were to slip even by a pinch, my mother would lose her bloody mind." Annabeth waved her off as she sloppily tucked her blouse into the kilt. Hopping along loosely to pull up that one knee high sock that was slipping.

"Oh bloody hell, Annabeth. I forgot to tell you." Piper cursed. "You're not going to be home for most of the evening!"

Annabeth's heart dropped. "What?!"

"Your mother called last night. I told her that you were in the shower and thankfully she bought it. She declared a lady called Mrs. Aresteo or something had invited you to dinner and told me to tell you to cancel any previous engagements you had. So… please try to sleep during class."

"Oh I could just die!" Annabeth huffed. Octavian's broad smug smile and twitchy hands crossing her mind as she stomped her foot childishly. "This is going to be one of the worst days ever!"
