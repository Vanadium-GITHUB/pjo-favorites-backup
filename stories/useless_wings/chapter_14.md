### Chapter 14
She was waiting by the stairs when Annabeth came romping in. Her hair way too messy from the wind and her blouse untucked from her kilt. She'd thrown her book bag off before noticing her mother. Stiff and totally unemotional as a single eyebrow was raised.

Instantly a stream of cold blood shot through her system and sent a jolt of panic right down to her core. Her mother's steely gaze making her freeze in her spot as the breath left her lungs.

"My office. Now." were the only cold petulant words that left her lips. A lingering look of equal disapproval and full on fury before she turned heavily on her feet and stormed into her office taking the suffocating aura with her. The door being shut with a firm yet hostile click.

Annabeth still couldn't breath though. Her mother was *angry*. Not the disappointed kind of angry that came and went like a passing leave on a gurgling stream. She was venimently angry. The kind that Annabeth knew she were to pay for dearly, and would haunt her in her mother's eyes with every look she got.

Her wings fluttered nervously as she looked in between Athena's office door and the front door. Heart pounding and mind traveling in a million places at once.

For a moment Annabeth just couldn't *deal* with this. She fearfully looked out the window as her heart thudded almost more violently in her chest. Knowing that someone was out there still probably trying to spy her through a pair of binoculars.

She'd seen the car follow her home. She knew they were there, waiting to pounce. That, and the fact that her mother was about to rip her piece from piece, Annabeth wanted nothing more then to melt into the floor and disappear from this world. She wanted this pressure off her chest.

But she couldn't. She was trapped. She had to take on one or the other.

*The mother it is.* She decided while trying to cool her pulse. Shakily stuffing her blouse back into her kilt and taking a second to run her fingers through her hair as if it'd help.

Taking a last breath of unease, Annabeth stepped up and stared at the white door. Her hands quivering and her throat tight as she reached out for the handle.

*But what's the punishment going to be.*

Her hand fell away.

*But if I'm any later then she'll be angrier.*

She touched the cool knob of the door. Its metal seeming to bite her flesh to ward her off, but she stayed there frozen.

*C'mon Annabeth, you got this.*

She urged herself on. Squeezing her eyes shut and taking a deep breath through her nose. Putting every second off until;

*Creak.*

The door let out a tiny complaint as she opened it. Her hand now gripping the handle fiercely as she hesitated again to enter the room. Her heart ascending to her throat and her mind in a fitz of total panic.

"Sit down Annabeth." Her mother's gaze was diamond sharp. Not leaving Annabeth for a second as she gestured to the seat in front of the desk. Every movement screaming disdain as she resumed her heated stare down.

*Two offices in one day.* Annabeth thought dryly to herself. Her body moving on its own as if Athena's command could never be disobeyed. Trying to move with as much grace as she could muster despite the amount of fear echoing in her mind.

She wished for the Principal's office now, where she had control and a sense of childish glee at her own power. Here, her mother was the all powerful. No room for debates, no room for arguments.

The comfortable chairs, and thick carpets in the Principal's office made it more homey too. Less threatening and jail like.

Athena's office was barren and very minimalistic. The smallish room itself was a hard grey, no wall decor or sentimental photos. There was a single case stocked to its brim with architecture and math texts, all organized alphabetically. Athena had an office desk that resembled a sharp 'L' with only a computer sitting on it. No pens, or papers, or objects on her desk or nestled beside books. It was straight, and clean cut just like Athena. Everything had a purpose.

The stark white chair with shiny silver peg legs had the sole purpose of serving Annabeth. This was her dunce cap, her time out in the corner. Everytime she was in that chair she was brought to her knees for whatever obscenity she had the moxy to do this time.

At least this time she had a clue as to why she was sitting in the chair. She had been dreading this deep down all day in fact.

Her suspicions were confirmed when Athena delicately took out a rustling newspaper. The front lines bolded and the words following her condemning the rest of her life probably.

*But for the public's reaction, it was worth it.*

"Would you have the decency to explain this abomination?" Her mother's hand harshly pushed the paper across the clear what surface of the desk. Annabeth's eyes landing on the writers name as if she had to really think on what she was seeing.

"I-" Annabeth started. Desperately thinking a good reason as to *why*. No, the 'for the sake of a woman who lost her boy' wasn't a good enough reason. Athena hardly believed in helping others who did not deserve it. Annabeth's act of charity for a complete stranger who lived a simple life in the *country* would only take her infuriated state to another level.

"And now you mock me with your lack of articulation. Haven't I provided you with the best education? Should you not have the know how to at least speak in a distinguished manner? Child how you agonize me with your selfishly belligerent ways. Now out with it. Why such a mockery to our family name? Why must you act upon the foolish ideas that spring into your mind?"

The silence that followed was almost as bad as the words Athena spat at her with daggers in her tone. It reminded Annabeth about how answerless she was. How incapable to come up with a reason. The silence is what drove the tears into her eyes, and a thorn into her heart.

*Why? Why am I so stupid? Why don't I have a reason?*

"Explain!" Athena demanded again. Jumping to her feet and smacking a hand down on the paper in front of Annabeth's eyes with a loud bang. The threat was there.

Annabeth flinched and bowed her head. Her wings trembling with fear and panic. Holding back the unacceptable tears and insufferable sobs she gripped her hands so tightly together she could hear her knuckles crack on one hand.

"I saw an injustice." she managed in a quivering voice, weak with fear and self doubt. "I acted upon it. Would you rather I did nothing?"

"Precisely." Athena didn't miss a cold beat. Eyes still on fire as moved around the edge of the desk. Her own white wings folded perfectly behind her in a serene tight way. "A lady does not draw unnecessary attention Annabeth. She is humble and discreet. By inspiring that article you have humiliated me in the utmost fashion."

Annabeth bowed her head further. Her eyes burning hotly as she swallowed down the tears and bubbles of self distaste.

"I'm sorry Mother."

"You must write to the news station. Apologize profusely but humbly and reclaim your statements. You've already blemished the family, but fates be upon us we might be able salvage some of your dignity. Am I understood?"

*Reclaim my statementsâ€¦*

Sally jumped into mind first. Alone and desperate in her little home. Wasting away as she baked blue chocolate chip cookies all day for no one to taste. Percy was second. Burdened with the memory of his best friends untimely demise as he sat in the wilderness missing his mom. It was all just so wrong. Somebody had to do something. Something had to change. Percy needed to be saved from the same fate as Grover.

"No." Instead of strong and courageous, it was weak and broken. A whisper on her lips so timidly spoken she thought for a moment her mother hadn't even heard her at all. She wished as much anyways.

"What?!" Athena hissed. For a second her wings broke their perfect pose and spread outwards in a threatening manner.

"No." Annabeth repeated with just as much uncertainty. Try as she might, she couldn't lift her head to see her mothers eyes. She wouldn't be able to stand to see how much wrath she had caused. "I've seen Sally Jackson. I know there is wrong here. If I must sacrifice my image as a lady to help her find answers, then so be it."

As noble as her words were, they fell on deaf ears.

"Image." Athena sniffed and walked stiffly back to her chair. Delicately seating herself as the room seemed to drop a few degrees in temperature. "Image." she repeated darkly. The anger gone from her voice as it was replaced with a deeper sense of broiling thought.

Annabeth suddenly found it hard to breath.

"You are correct." Her mother exhaled. "You only hold the 'image' of a lady. For all my classes, for all my hard work, for all my pain to turn you into a 'lady' and you only retain the 'image' of one."

Annabeth felt a throb of curiosity and peeked up between her curtain of hair. Her eyes scanning the face of her mother. Her unreadable expression more terrifying than that of her angry face.

She couldn't breath.

"I will write to the news station myself." Athena sighed. "Explain your foolishness and lack of intelligence. You will no longer be permitted to see Miss Mclean. I have made the mistake of allowing you into the company of one not worthy. She has obviously had too much of an influence on your impressionable personality."

"Mother-" Annabeth gasped desperately.

One cold look. One more warning, and Annabeth fell silent. She couldn't breath. Her heart started to bleed at the thought of losing Piper.

"Furthermore you shall not be attending University in the fall. I'll see to it you will receive a private tutor so you may study from home. You shall also retake your classes on manners, poise, and social decency. Any protest will result in further correction. Am I understood?"

And there it was. The full punishment laid fresh and awful on the table as Annabeth was forced to look her future in the face. No Piper, no University, more lady classes. It was a future she knew would kill her.

But she couldn't breath. She couldn't protest. She had nothing in her left to lift her head and say otherwise. She was being taken down by this woman. By her own mother.

So she nodded numbly. Trying so hard not to cry that it made her chest ache. If she cried she'd just get into more trouble.

Ladies weren't supposed to cry.

"Now go to your room and get dressed. You are to attend the Aresto's garden party this evening. Heaven forbid the topic of your ghastly article surfaces."

She felt empty. She felt devoid. This wasn't her life. She'd tried to make it her own by rebelling in the tiniest ways, doing pranks and taking off into the green strip, but even that seemed so little now.

*I'm sorry.* She wanted to cry. *I'm sorry I'm not who you want me to be. I'm sorry I'm a disappointment.*

It was wrong. She was sorry for being herself and it was wrong. Somewhere deep down she felt it was wrong but she denied it any significance. She could only feel how much of a flaming failure she was. She could only see the faults she had done against her mother.

Before she knew it she was out in the hall. Staring lost at the floor as she finally let the swelling tears fall. She didn't dare let the sobs pass through her pursed lips though. If her mother heard her, she would probably have to do pots all week on top of everything else.

A lady doesn't make such pitiful noises after all.

"Annabeth?" Malcolm came cheerily around the corner before halting completely. His eyes grazing over her as if to look for injury before noticing her position.

How she was standing brokenly with her back facing the cursed office. Even if she wasn't standing tear streaked by the office door, Annabeth had a hunch he could probably tell by the crumpled look in her eyes. Malcolm could just sense these things.

"What did she do?" he choked out as he rushed to her side. Throwing an arm around her trembling shoulders as Annabeth whimpered into his shirt.

"I'm banned from visiting Piper." she sniffled. Her words muffled and soft. Her gut twisting at the sourness of how it tasted to say it. "And she's going to be withdrawing me from University."

"Why?!" Malcolm gaped at her. Landing both of her sturdy shoulders to pry her away and look her in the eyes. "Why is she doing this?"

"I inspired today's front page article." Annabeth muttered miserably. "I was trying to help a family."

Malcolms jaw tightened. That hardy calculating look came into his eyes as he sorted out his thoughts. His expression was one Annabeth couldn't help but feel relief to see.

He was going to do something.

He was always able to talk their mother out of things. He had this edge on her that others wished to posses. She'd listen to him.

"Go to your room." he directed sternly. "I'll see what I can do."

"Thank you." Annabeth breathed. Giving him another grateful hug before gently heading towards the stairs. Keeping her eyes on him as he gave her a last brave smile before he disappeared into the office.

She could hear Malcolm yelling from her room a few minutes later. She couldn't make out any words, only muffled noises of distress. Her mother raised her voice an equal share of times only when she was over ruling one of his statements. They weren't confined to Athena's small office either. By the sound of it, Malcolm was following her throughout the house. Hounding her in his own way as Athena's shoes clacked against the hardwood.

Annabeth stayed with her back pressed against the door of her room. Her eyes roaming over the bookshelves full of her favorite volumes, and her desk littered with school papers, the bare walls. Tears still hot and heavy as they rolled down her cheeks and splattered on the floor.

A dress was laid out on her tidy bed. White with scattered dark pink roses blooming in clusters and light purple flowers. The branching wispy green leaves added just the right amount of freshness, while the thin black belt added a focal point to the dress.

Annabeth couldn't care enough to hate it. Her heart was squeezed tightly at her 'punishment'. All the plans she had made with Piper to do over the summer and through out University flashed through her mind. The dreams dissolving as her hopes slowly crumbled.

*Malcolm please pull through.* She gripped her hands together tightly in desperate hope. Looking to the ceiling as if somebody up there could help her losing battles.

From below, Malcolm voice hit a high and a door slammed, sending a violent shiver through the house. Silence swarmed the atmosphere acidicly as Annabeth's shoulders fell. Her brother had lost.

*No hope.* She slipped down the wood of her door. Hugging her legs close to her chest as she tried not to deflate into sobs and cries again. Her heart beat pattering against her knees. Her throat feeling thick and dry.

Dismally she peeled her swollen eyes away from the hardwood floor and looked out the window. Thin wispy clouds framed an all too blue sky. Her wings twitched at the idea of flight.

Oh how she wished she could just fly away from this all. Hide in cloud banks and soaring through the crystal skies. The wind catching in her wings. The feeling of freedom being what she truly wanted the most.

Delicately, she rose to her feet and felt her kilt fall back into place. With tender steps she floated forward and dared to peek outside. A jump in her pulse as she spotted the black car parked right outside her house. The blackened windows revealing not even a silhouette to her.

Suddenly a burst of anger was injected into her veins with a hot burst of blood. She grit her teeth as her wings shuddered in hatred.

*How dare they.* She seethed. *Following me around. Keeping me confined.*

Briskly, she took her phone out of her pocket and took a discreet picture of the car. Disappointed that it was angled in such a way that she failed to catch the license number, but satisfied enough that she sent the photo off to the editor of the newspaper. A tart note following the photo as she explained exactly what it was. Her words biting and angry.

A soft knock startled the phone out of her hands followed by a timid; "Annabeth?"

Malcolm was at her door. Sympathy rang deep in his eyes and an apologetic smile curved up the corners of his lips lightly.

Annabeth turned her gaze down and stared at the corner of her dark brown bookshelf. Pursing her lips as she tried to hide the bubbling disappointment inside. Malcolm hated it when she was disappointed.

"I'm terribly sorry." He muttered. "I was only able to convince her to drop the University restriction punishment. I'm afraid you will be kept from visiting Piper this summer."

Annabeth's wings fluttered.

"What?"

"You're still going to University." Malcolms eyes grew bright and a broadening smile breached his lips.

"Malcolm-" Annabeth gasped as she raced towards him. Tackling him into a hug as a million thank-you's flew to her tongue. Happiness dancing in her stomach in tugs.

"Don't give me your gratitude yet." He said in a darker tone as he pushed her gently away from his torso. "She still has half a mind to keep you on a chain if you continue on such ways. Understood?"

Annabeth nodded.

"Good gal. Now get ready. All of my work will be undone of you're late for this spotless event you are to attend."

Annabeth's heart sunk slightly. "You're not joining me?"

Malcolm pursed his lips. Again the look of sympathy dawned in his eyes. "Neither I nor Mother was not included in the invite. This invite was sacredly for you alone coming directly from Octavian."

*Alone.* Annabeth shuddered. *Alone with Octavian of all people.*

"Lovely." Annabeth rolled her eyes. A sour look enveloping her face as if she had smelled some disgustingly pungent odour.

"I know." Malcolm agreed with the same look of distaste. "I have a feeling he's not too fond of me."

Annabeth snorted. "Please, you're making me utterly green with envy. Heaven knows what I would do just to be on that boys bad side."

-{:oOo:}-

Annabeth arrived before any other guests. She was instantly greeted by Octavian who decided it was appropriate to kiss her cheek (ew). Upon her arrival, Octavian looped an arm around her and decided that it would be fit to show her the preparations and give her the inside on exactly what would be taking place that evening.

The large perfectly trimmed lawn bordered with flowers was now peppered with round white linened tables. Centerpieces of lilies, and tulips sitting in crystal vases let off a heavy fragrance that Annabeth fought not to choke on. Strings of warm lit lights were above them while an army of neatly tailored servants worked like ants on the remaining set up.

Octavian pointed out the platform being set up for a special live performance of some sorts and then promptly positioned her beside him at the party areas entrance as the first guests started to arrive.

*Not even a hint of Mr. or Mrs. Aresto being home.* Annabeth sent a wondering glance up to the house. Letting her eyes fall upon the glinting windows that seemed pink in the dying sun. Curious as to why Mrs. Aresto, a.k.a the ultimate host, wasn't present to receive guests and make light conversation.

"Octavian! My good man!"

Annabeth restrained another eyeroll. Sick of greeting hoards of people as they filed into this event. All of them looked the same, all of them spoke the same, all of them acted the same. She could not recall a single face of whom she greeted because they all seemed to be clones of each other. Besides that, her neck and spine prickled with pain at being so straight, and her thighs burned at the amount of times she'd curtsied. Her heels would settle in the grass so every once in a while she would have to shift. The only thing she could imagine was her mother's disappointed glare.

"Johnson! What a pleasure! Thank you for coming," Octavian beamed at the pudgy guy as they clasped hands.

"Why thank you for having me. I was delighted upon receiving the invite," he replied with a broad grin. His thick black hair momentarily falling in front of his eyes before he slicked it back. A petite raven haired girl holding onto his arm delicately as she maintained an insanely plastic smile that even Annabeth could see directly through.

*Shoulders back, gut in, pleasant smile. PLEASANT smile!* That detail obsessed voice in her head whispered maliciously as the attention was suddenly shifted to her.

"And who is this exquisite crowning jewel?" Johnson asked in a way Annabeth couldn't help but find slightly lewd. His grazing eyes even made his date uncomfortable. Thank heavens not all the guests were like this.

"Johnson, this is the very talented, very lovely Annabeth Chase," Octavian introduced with what sounded like pride.

"It's a pleasure to meet you Johnson," Annabeth stated silkily. Offering him her hand delicately as she had to the many before him.

He kissed her hand then proceeded to grin again as if his lips were perpetually stuck in a peeled back manner. "If you would allow me to say, Miss Chase, Octavian is one lucky man this evening."

Annabeth feigned bashfulness and looked to the ground as if embarrassed. "You flatter me."

*I am not WITH him.* She wanted to scream. Throbs of anger heating her blood as Octavian bid them an enjoyable evening and the next guest stepped forward to be greeted.

Annabeth's breath almost left her throat as a vaguely familiar blonde reached out a hand to shake Octavians.

"Jason Grace, I'm glad you could make it. Couldn't secure a lady for this evening?" Octavian grinned a row of pearly white teeth. His eyes squinting to more shrew like as he greeted the classily dressed guy.

Jason shot him a pursed smile. "Thank you for inviting me. And no, I did not think to bring a friend." Yet his lightning blue eyes behind his bold framed glasses seemed lackluster at the occasion.

"Mhmm that's too bad." Octavian nodded along sympathetically.

Annabeth bit back the urge to jump away as she felt the snaking hand of Octavian as it softly landed on the small of her back. His eager tone following as he continued to *show her off* as if she were one of his dumb stuffed taxidermy in his trophy room. It was obvious that Octavian thought of her as a *date*.

"Jason, this elegant being is-"

"Annabeth Chase." Jason finished with a hint of surprise in his voice. His eyes lighting up as he took the hand she offered and kissed it swiftly out of formality.

"Hello Jason. It's wonderful to see you again." Annabeth couldn't help but deliver a genuine smile. A gush of relief hitting her at having *someone* at this dang event who she vaguely knew. Even if they had only ever been in each others presence for a few minutes, Annabeth still felt as if she had a good idea of who 'Jason Grace' was. From that one time Piper accidently bumped into him, she had been non-stop talking about how great he was. That spoke for something.

"Youâ€¦ know each other." Octavian seemed to put his guard up. A hostile glance being sent Jason's way while Annabeth felt another strong urge to slap the pale boy with twitchy hands.

"Only just." Jason confessed, not taking his eyes off her. "We crossed paths only last week."

"At a soda shop no less." Annabeth suppressed a giggle. "Jason had the courtesy to nail my dear friend in the head with a door."

Jason's smile broadened. "But in my defense it put me in company with some very admirable ladies."

Annabeth felt a light blush dust against the peaks of her cheeks. Her smile only growing at his well put compliment.

"That it did." she agreed. Locking eyes with the guy as she remembered the incident that felt like a forever ago. His lightning blue eyes reeling her in.

*But it was only last week.* She thought to herself. *Time is just dragging by.*

"Well." Octavian's hand pressed harder into her back possessively and Annabeth bit back a protest. The eye contact breaking. A colder undertone taking over his voice as he boiled in his spot. "Enjoy the party Jason."

"With such company, how could I not?"

Okay, now he was only *provoking* Octavian. Annabeth could tell by the dancing glint in his eyes as he spoke. The tempting message saying *fight me* boldly.

*Don't smile.* She cursed herself. *Shoulders back! Chest out! Wings straight and still!*

"Goodbye Jason." Octavian glowered. No hidden emotions in his eyes. His hand traveling a bit lower on her back making her wings tremble with a dash of hate.

"Goodbye." Jason waved as he walked away. Leaving her again with Octavian as one of the final guests stepped forward. His blonde hair sticking out in the crowd of people mingling in clumps. Servants working the party with silver trays of expensive drinks. The backdrop of the purple sky, and fiery red clouds making it quite the breathtaking scene.

The sunset would've been more breathtaking from the view of Percy's treehouse.

"Michael! It's been too long!"

"Naturally Octavian. The drive here was hellish. I still fail to grasp the reason as to why you moved so far away." A bored looking chap with the height of a giraffe surveyed the party without a twitch of his eyebrow. "And yet, in such a place you still manage to throw one hell of a get together."

"Thank you Michael. You are as kind as ever." Octavian's pressed smile appeared and his smug stance deepened. "Michael, allow me to introduce you to Annabeth Chase."

On que Annabeth stuck out her hand and watched curiously as this 'Michael' took it with an odd thoughtfulness in his eyes.

"Annabeth Chase," he repeated as if testing the name on his tongue. "Now where have I met you before? Your name is devilishly familiar."

*The newspaper.* Annabeth did a mental facepalm. *Of course, my name holds some fame now.*

Instead of revealing anything Annabeth smiled pleasantly and let a humored yet birdsong sound of a chuckle roll off her lips. "I can't imagine why," she let loose the really dazzling smile. "To my knowledge, we have only just met."

Michael shrugged it off. "I'm sure it will come to me." he muttered as he abruptly walked away. His eyes clouded with thoughts as he racked his brains.

*What an odd duck.* Annabeth watched him leave. A small dose of relief in her heart that he didn't know where her name was from. That he didn't bring up the newspaper.

Oh how her mother would tear her to pieces if she made a bad impression tonight in front of all these people.

-{:oOo:}-

Well it was hellish. Surprised? Probably not.

Annabeth spent the majority of her night smiling and nodding to the up and coming heirs of big companies. She sat right beside Octavian during supper as he boasted about his most recent hunting adventure, pretending to be engaged by the conversations but was really thinking about Percy. Someone she *knew* she shouldn't be thinking about. Someone who she didn't think she'd be thinking about ever but was. His confession just seemed to be on her mind as bizarre as it was.

His hard eyes when he told her how he felt, his strong stature when he repeated it. Just remembering the sureness in his voice was enough to make her wings shiver. She caught herself looking distantly into the glimmer of strung lights, or the dark void of the sky hanging right over her head several times. It was disgraceful.

By the time the main course was over, and the servants branched out to pass around fresh berries in thick creams, Annabeth had just about enough of being there.

She was always being looked at. Always being judged by every pair of eyes around her. Her dress, her makeup, her posture, her voice, her looks, her poise, her grace, her everything. She caught a couple of girls whispering her way and that was when she decided to give herself a much needed break. She couldn't hold the mask to her face for much longer without bursting.

So, elegantly, she excused herself from the table and stepped down the lawn to go to the powder room. Catching more eyes as they watched her go. Some curious looks, some snooty gazes, some adoring glances and some hateful glares all followed her likes ghosts. She could almost feel their eyes on her skin, sticking there like layers of cobwebs.

She was glad when she turned a corner and disappeared from the party. Sighing heavily as she brought a manicured hand up to rub her neck exhaustedly. Trying to ease the pain out of her joints by walking slowly and without a slightest pinch of forced grace. A knot of mental exhaustion throbbing in her brain.

Somehow she ended up on a balcony overlooking the party. She just saw a door and wandered out as if she owned this house. It was too pretty not to go out onto honestly. The thick clusters of piercing white stars scattered across the sky were visible and contrasted to the warm yellow lights of the party loudly going on below.

Carelessly, she pried the hot heels from her pinched feet and let them tumble to the ground. Moaning in sweet relief at the alleviation of her discomfort while the thick stone balcony was cool and soothing against her soles. Quietly she glanced around at the assortment of potted ivy plants and small palm trees with a feeling peace. Relishing her small moment alone while a humid heavy breeze rolled over her.

She sunk into the wrought iron victorian bench without a second thought. Grumbling to herself at how uncomfortable it was. The biting metal had designs hammered onto it that poked into her back and wings like pressuring fingers.

Then she just sat there feeling listless and aged. It was almost as if she were a china doll when she wore this mask. Her only purpose was to sit still, look pretty and appease children. So fragile, and delicate that they could smash her at any moment.

In this case, Octavian was the child. A bad impression on him meant a word to her mother which meant her life would quite literally be restricted. Annabeth's esophagus twisted at just the thought of not going to University, of never seeing Piper again.

Thank heavens for Malcolm though.

"So you and Octavian huh." the sentence was stated with the same lack of energy Annabeth was feeling.

Sitting up, Annabeth swiveled around and could only stare wide eyed at Jason as he leaned casually against the arched door frame of the balcony. His tie had been loosened clumsily and the first two buttons of his shirt undone, while a lazy bottle of alcohol was firmly clutched in his left hand.

"Octavian and I?" Annabeth perched an eyebrow as she stared at the boy.

"You're a couple." he nodded solemnly. "I never expected him to gain favor from any girl, let alone a girl such as yourself."

Annabeth couldn't contain it. For all her lady classes, and esteemed training, she couldn't hold in the snort.

"Octavian is a foul headed, sexist perv who'd I'd *love* to bash over the head with the most expensive wine offered at this party." she spat. Her silky tone gone, and mask completely off. Angrily she glared at Jason with a fizz of contempt. "Him and I would and will *never* be an item."

Jason looked taken aback. For a moment his eyes fell to the floor before he straightened up and gently walked up to her. Fumbling with something in his pocket with one hand.

"Then please explain this." he muttered with his brows pinched together.

A piece of bent cardstock was placed in front of Annabeth. A cream stationary with darker gold lettering printed in neat cursive. All in all it was a beautiful invite, complete with a winding flowered border. It was what the invite say that peeved Annabeth to no end.

'You are cordially invited to Octavian Aresto and Miss Annabeth Chase's garden party.'

"Octavian Aresto *and* Miss Annabeth," she hissed. "He's practically selling me as his significant other."

"So he's not your beau?" Jason asked curiously. Timidly reaching out his hand to take back the forsaken piece of paper and slide it easily back into his suits pocket.

"Heaven forbid, no." Annabeth growled. Crossing her arms heatedly as she glared over the marble edge of the balcony to the unknowing party guests laughing and talking lightly.

"Then why are you here, beside him no less." Jason pushed his glasses back up his nose and casually fell in beside her to stare at the party with a hint of disgust. Wavering once or twice before he gestured to the bench and they both took a seat. The party slipping out of sight by the thick banister.

"My mother made me." she humphed. "I am to make a good impression on Aresto's because of a grand favor they gave my mother eons ago."

To her surprise, Jason laughed a little loudly. Showing his pearly white teeth as he let his head fall back and tip towards the sky.

"I know how that feels." he grinned at her with a bit of sympathy clinging to his sparkling eyes.

Annabeth paused. Her eyebrows furrowing before she cocked her head at the boy in a questioning manner.

"Are you drunk?" she asked quietly. As if her statement could possible be heard by someone else on this barren balcony.

Jason shrugged. His expression growing mundane as his gaze once again settled on the stars.

"A bit." he confessed. "Not drunk enough to make a blithering idiot out of myself, but just enough that this party seems bearable."

"Do you drink... often?" Annabeth posed the question delicately. She couldn't imagine Piper going out with a heavy drinker. She would never let Piper go out with a heavy drinker that is.

Jason scoffed instead. "Nah. I only ever touch the devil's drink when Octavian is present. I hate that guy."

"Makes sense." she sighed. Sinking slightly into the hard metal bench because dammit she didn't have to have a straight ass spine around Jason.

No sooner had she spoken then Jason generously offered her the bottle of alcohol he'd probably pinched from a passing waiter. The expensive brand still had a cork in the lips, and condensation glimmering on the sides making the neck slippery and cold. Through shine from the stars it had this tempting glow about it that Annabeth had to turn her head away from.

"I don't have a glass," she stammered. Grasping at any excuse that would bubble to her lips.

Jason rolled his eyes. "Why would you require a glass? Just drink it from the bottle."

Annabeth chewed on her lower lip. A part of her really wanting to be just a little drunk. Just a little out of this whole horrible party.

"My mother would want me to have a glass."

"Oh please." Jason chuckled. "And since when have you always done what your mother wished behind closed doors? As I recall, Piper regaled me on your most adventurous of pranks."

*Traitor*. Annabeth thought with a blush warming her cheeks. Thanking the darkness for probably hiding it.

"Alright." she broke in. Taking the bottle and popping off the cork in one smooth motion. The liquid fizzed over the nozzle and tickled her fingers before she could bring it to her lips and take a large gulp.

It was cold and sweet and went down smoother than a milkshake. The bubbles feathering the roof of her mouth before she could swallow. With another long draught, Annabeth set the bottle in her lap and shivered as the drink raced down her esophagus. Warmth webbing its way around her torso as she set her stare on the bottles label.

"Damn that's good," she hiccuped.

"Only the finest at the Aresto's." Jason smiled at her. Leisurely sliding his arms behind his head. Somehow looking comfortable on this 'purely picturesque' bench in his slouched down position.

Annabeth nodded lightly. Indulging in another long swig as the silence ate holes in their conversation. The thick breeze threatened to mess up Annabeth's tightly bound hair, but for the first time that evening, she didn't care.

"What was the meaning of 'I know how it feels'," she asked suddenly. Looking out onto the distant lawns and trimmed hedges. Her eyes falling onto the very distance dog kennels.

"I'm here simply because my father wants me here." Jason revealed. "My only use to him is to keep up with connections to families with business ties."

Annabeth snorted with a half smile on her face. "Let me guess. You had to take gentlemen classes," she said jokingly.

"Yup."

"Whoa, no shit?"

Okay hold up. Her mouth just got ten times looser. She startled herself so much she flinched. Her mood had changed on a dime just from a few simple sips of some strong stuff. She felt relaxed, and free and like she had the ability to do anything. For a moment she just sat there dumbfounded as she stared wide eyed at the bottle. Blaming it for everything she was feeling at the moment while Jason just laughed beside her. A humored tone deep in his voice that snapped her out of the bewildered stupor.

"Yes." he chuckled. "No shit."

"Uncanny," Annabeth grinned. "I had to participate in Ladylike classes myself."

"Classroom or home tutored?" Jason raised an eyebrow.

"Home tutored."

"Same."

"What about your parents?" Annabeth found herself asking. Brushing a topic she rarely would go near on account to how tender the subject was personally. Her voice going quiet and shy as if it were reflecting her own parental situation. "Are they stern?"

"My Father is," Jason shrugged. From the corner of her eye she could see that his gaze had hardened on the stars.

"Probably unemotional and seemingly cold right? Always disapproving and disappointed in everything you do." The words just came out of her mouth without her having to think about it. The world seemed too sharp and clear up here in that moment of silence that heavily descended upon them.

"How did you know?" Jason asked softly without looking at her. His chiseled jaw was set, and his wings fluttered once.

"My mother's the same way," she breathed. Remembering the office, the stare, the total anger and hatred pulsing in her eyes. The feeling of failure and unworthiness.

"What about your father?" he inquired. This time his electric blue eyes landed on her. Serious yet calm as they seemed to reach inside her and make her pulse jump. The bench suddenly seemed warm beneath her.

"Dead. You're mother?" She answered and asked simultaneously.

"Dead." Jason shot her a pursed smile and a 'hang in there' look.

"Car Wreck?" Annabeth tilted her head towards him. Searching his eyes before he shook his head solemnly.

"Suicide."

"Oh."

The breeze burst to life again. Rolling over the grounds and hushing in the few large ancient oaks peppering the property. From behind her Annabeth could hear the potted plants shift and hiss as the wind danced with their leaves. She took another swig from the bottle, her head already feeling thick.

From below the web of lights came a piercing cheer of someone who was enjoying themselves way too much. Their cry of joy was soon joined by many others as they cried for more drinks.

Annabeth brought her bare feet up to sit cross legged. Turning herself tartly to face Jason with a few questions bouncing around her eyes. Jason's loyal attention already on her.

"You don't think, that perhaps you should've told your father 'no'," Annabeth phrased slowly.

Jason's eyebrows furrowed. He quipped his lips back in a quick thoughtful purse before asking; "No to what that is?"

Annabeth waved her hands as if to clear the air from her first question. Her movements perhaps a bit sloppier then it would be on normal days. "Okay, so I have this friend."

"Piper?"

"Not Piper. Just a bloke, barely a friend. He's more of an... acquaintance," Annabeth explained with a sting of guilt at calling Percy 'barely a friend'. "And he believes that I shouldn't listen to my Mother most of the time. And I was just wondering, since you are in a scenario similar to mine, if you would say 'no' to your father on any occasion."

Jason thought on this for a moment. His eyes momentarily clouding before he slowly shook his head.

"He knows what's best," he decided in a final voice. "I shouldn't try and over rule his decisions. I may not like doing everything he asks, but he's right when he says all of these connections will benefit me."

Annabeth's white wings shivered in excitement as he *agreed* with her. *Finally* someone agreed. For a moment she just stared at the boy sitting in front of her. His neatly combed blonde hair, his loosened tie fluttering slightly in the breeze, his lightning blue eyes flicking over her face.

*Lucky Pipes.*

"I completely concur," she beamed at him. "You are the first personâ€¦ I don't know, to completely understand me."

It was a cliche line, but it fit the moment. She was a bit too tipsy to care anyways, and judging by the flush on Jason's cheeks he didn't care either.

"Wanna know a secret?" Jason mumbled gently. The corner of his lips twitching up almost adoringly when Annabeth wavered slightly and then giggled.

"What," she whispered just as amused. Leaning in closer to hear his soft spoken words.

"I'm actually enjoying Octavian's party now," he breathed slightly slurred. A myriad of emotions floating through his eyes as his face suddenly grew serious. The why he was enjoying it written in his body language.

"Me too," she realized while scrunching her eyebrows together. Trying to put together exactly what was happening. What she was feeling.

Then he kissed her.

At first she froze like a doe caught in the glaring headlights. Rigid and unsure as his hands found her shoulders.

But when he tried to break away she chased after him and fell into his chest. Kissing him softly as his hands found her waist and held her close. Throbs of warmth spinning through her gut and a strangled ache swimming in her heart. She could hear his wings flutter when she cradled his cheeks with her hands. Her lips burning with every move.

It was slow, and comfort seeking. Nothing like the kiss she had with Percy. It made her stomach dance with butterflies but her head spin with guilt and maybe it was the alcohol but Annabeth was pretty sure she was seeing stars.

All it took was a dull knock by the door to make them reel apart.

A neatly tailored butler was standing stiff and emotionless by the door. Looking like a grim reaper through the darkness with his eyes far away from them when he said; "Miss Annabeth, Master Octavian is inquiring of your whereabouts."

Reality zoomed back into focus again. Guilt pelting her in the face like a sharp right hook as she thought of Piper and of Percy.

*Oh my goodness, what am I doing.*

It took her three tries to speak.

"Uhâ€¦ rightâ€¦ yesâ€¦ I'll be right there."
