Well, at least this is starting to go some where.

### Chapter 6
"His eyes are blue." Piper uttered dreamily as she floated along the sidewalk parallel to Annabeth. So lost in space thanks to Jason Grace that it left Annabeth feeling like she was tugging a helium balloon alongside herself instead of a best friend.

"Not like the steel kind of blue, or like the heavy ocean blue. Not too dark but not too light. Like a nice blue. Like a sky blue. It's delightful."

*Percy's eyes are green.* The thought casually popped into her mind. A wild kind of sparkling green. *Maybe it's darker around the rims?*

"And his hair is like a warm sunlight! Not like your divine gold locks but like a lighter finer colour." Piper babbled on as they passed under the thick old oak. Stepping over the usual cracks and ignoring the heat basking off the unshielded sun. Taking subconscious moments to glance at the slowly passing houses with rich multicoloured flower beds and pristine decorated windows.

*Percy's hair is like the night. Like ebony. Is it soft? I wonder.*

"And his wings!" Piper gushed as Annabeth nodded along with her mind in the clouds. "He's got black tipped wings just like me! But none of that putrid brown clots of colour at the top."

*Are Percy's wings really completely black? Perhaps there is some minor detail to him that I have missed.*

"Soooo muscular." she sighed. Arms outstretched dramatically as if she were about to accept a hug from a bear.

*He is I guess. But living in the middle of the woods is bound to be rough. One must have muscle to survive.*

"And I simply adore the way he's clean shaven! It gives him such a clean look! Such a gentleman charm!"

*How the devil does Percy shave?! What witchcraft is he presenting in which he can fly and live in the middle of the bloody forest without looking half bad?!*

"Don't you just think that it was fate that I bumped into him before my visit to his estate? Someone mighty powerful must be intertwining our stars!" Piper squealed with a little hop.

*How on earth did I managed to meet Percy the world mystery? I mean, it's a frightfully big forest and what are the chances that he would drop into the exact same spot that I was in?!*

"Oh Annabeth! You must come over tomorrow to help me pick out a suitable outfit!"

"Wait what?" Annabeth's thought bubble shattered as she twisted to stare at her friend in confusion. Skimming a lock of hair out of her face in the process.

Piper huffed in annoyance while her wings fluttered slightly. "Weren't you even listening to me?!"

"Dreamy eyes, toyable hair, enchanting wings, perfect body, clean shaven." Annabeth recited while emptying her mind of Percy. "I just didn't catch that last bit about an outfit. Or at least I'm somewhat confused. Since you are set to go riding, isn't a simple t-shirt and a pair of jeans already cut out for the job?"

"I'd prefer to at least *look* like a lady, none the less act like one." Piper rolled her eyes. The fork in their road fast approaching and Annabeth once more wishing for the street to go on and on.

"Than I'll see what I can do, alright?" she raised an eyebrow at her pretty friend. "But no promises on glamour or a drop dead look. Got it?"

"Got it." Piper flashed a brilliant white smile with her perfect teeth and held up a steady thumb.

"Alright now Soldier, you are free from duty. Go squeal into your pillow over a man you just met." Annabeth smirked playfully while giving Piper a hearty pat on the shoulder. The forking streets each ready to receive a walking pedestrian.

Piper threw her hand up in her normal, gawky yet theatrical worthy salute. "A week and four days General, and then we shall be free of this war!"

"And a scathingly brilliant idea for a final prank has awakened!" Annabeth remarked gleefully over her shoulder as she walked. "So be on your guard Miss Mclean! A storm is brewing for those pesky teachers!"

From behind her, Annabeth could hear Piper squealing delightfully and dancing around like a world class goofball.

"I CAN'T WAIT!" The giggle filled shriek echoed after her.

Annabeth smiled the rest of the way home. A light hop in her movements and a sky high feeling in her chest.

She felt like she could fly.

"Annabeth!" her name caught her attention as soon as she gingerly stepped onto the drive.

Her mother waved her over with a simple flick of a wrist.

"Annabeth, could you drive these things out to the thrift store?" she asked with a tone in her voice that said; *I'll be disappointed if you don't.*

Annabeth's eyebrows furrowed as she examined the boxes mounded in her mother's SUV. Crisp and obviously packed as they took up every seat with the word *Thrift* scribbled neatly in marker. Curiosity fizzled behind her eyes as she looked to her mother for answers.

"Malcolm's old slacks and shirts and whatnot that he's long since grown out of. Plus a few trinkets that were lying uselessly in the basement. I thought the things might have a better shot of use in someone else's abode." Athena elegantly explained while gently placing the set of keys into Annabeth's hand. "Now no dilly dallying. Keep your wallet and phone on you. Crystal clear?"

"As clear as glass." Annabeth sighed as she slung her backpack off her shoulder and vaulted it into the passenger seat. Shutting the doors with the utmost care to try and prevent any complaints.

Athena groaned anyways. "Child, please, do not ever throw things so carelessly! A lady does not throw!"

"Sorry mother." Annabeth muttered as she walked around the car. Staring at the black asphalt so she would not see her mother's disappointing gaze. Her wings crumpling slightly in regret.

"Drive safely." Athena instructed through the open window. "And straighten your tie!"

Scowling, Annabeth took her hands off the wheel and yanked at the stubborn piece of fabric before smoothing down her blouse and tugging at her kilt in hopes of a substantial change.

"Better?" she asked with a winning smile.

"Better." Her mother affirmed. Chin high as always, and with a perfect board straight posture. Her hair bound up in a tight professionally updo.

"Bye!"

With that, Annabeth peeled out of the driveway and took off. Wind flying through her curls and feathers. Reminding her what it truly felt like to fly.

-{:oOo:}-

"Cripe!" Annabeth swore as she nosed through the last box. Every item of clothing being either too small, or unsuitable for forest living.

Malcolm was of a smaller build after all. Not that Percy was large, Malcolm was just small. Too small to steal any of his old belongings and graciously donate them to the boy in the treehouse. Nothing he owned or had owned would ever fit Percy. That was the bottom line.

If Malcolm was a size small, that made Percy a size medium.

So, with her leather wallet in hand and after dumping the pile of boxes at the drop off, Annabeth paraded into the store. Appreciating the chill of the air conditioner while recoiling at the smell of old shoes, dust, and molding plaster. Carefully she maneuvered herself around old ladies with saggy shirts over the shopping wheel streaked floor. Hobbling sideways down an aisle created by two rusty racks, Annabeth then dove head in to picking out a new wardrobe for Percy.

Both times she had seen him, he'd been in a simple black tee and a pair of worn jeans. The evidence of other clothes turned out to be moth eaten rags and indicated that he needed the whole deal.

Hoodies.

Sweaters.

Shorts.

Tees.

Long sleeves.

Jeans.

Pants.

Sweats.

Pajamas.

They were all going in the cart. Piling up while still being affordably cheap with fifty cent price tags.

Hangers clicked as she worked, and clothes flashed by. Sometimes she just threw things in the cart because she thought they'd look cute on him. Squealing internally slightly when she found a soft black and white hoodie with little panda ears on them. Already imagining Percy glowering at her as he wore it.

Satisfied, she wheeled her ladened cart to the checkout and dropped the entire haul onto the counter. Smiling cheekily at the gaping checkout clerk.

"And yes. I want a receipt." Annabeth gleamed proudly. Watching patiently as he started to dig through the pile to get at tags, and barcodes. The scanner beeping pleasantly with each red flash.

Paying, she left with two supersized bags that barely skimmed the ground. Knowing that she'd just blown a good chunk of money, but surprisingly happy that she did.

Disregarding what her mother said earlier, Annabeth threw the bags in the car and took off. Shades on, and an arm out the window like a real hick. She stopped once at her favorite diner to get two burgers, a batch of fries, some crispy onion rings and two shakes.

Before she knew it, Annabeth had hobbled her way through thick jagged forest with two heavy bags of clothes, and a two person meal.

Forlornly, she stared up at the old tree. The little shelter barely visible in its maze of leaves and twigs. Nestled cozily between two sturdy branches. The breeze caressing the limbs into a river of movements.

*I can't climb all the way up there with all of this.* Annabeth deduced. Remembering sourly how hard it was to crawl up this dang tree with a tupper ware stuffed under the crook of her arm. Her knee high socks catching on the rough edges of bark and her kilt flying up every two seconds because of the perverted wind.

Gently, Annabeth lay her bags on the ground between two roots. Stepping back before she gracefully cupped her hands to her lips.

"KNOCK KNOCK PERCY!" she called out as loud as she could. Her voice reaching far out into the vast woods, making the critters pause in their day to day life. "I NEED YOU TO-"

And suddenly he was there. Crushing her against the trunk of the tree with his body. Eyes hard with a warning and muscles stiff against hers causing her wings to flutter rapidly out of fear. His majestic wings were folded as tightly as they could go behind his back.

His hand was slapped against her mouth as he kept them huddled against the tree as if to hide from something.

"Shut up." he hissed. Alarm woven in his voice. "Don't ever do that again!"

*His eyes are darker on the rims.* Annabeth observed unfazed. Reaching delicately up to pull his hand away. Eyebrows knitted as Percy craned his neck to peer around the tree.

"What the-"

"Shhhh!"

She could feel his heart beating rapidly against her chest. Coursing through his tense arms placed on either side of her. The crease in Annabeth's brows grew deeper as she placed a placid palm against his heart to feel the wild beats.

A shiver ignited from her touch and Percy gasped with a startling flinch. Staring at her open mouthed like she had just violated a sacred code. "What are you doing?!" he exclaimed breathily.

"Why are you so scared?" Annabeth returned the look while pushing his chest slightly to ease him off her.

Percy only grabbed her wrist. Fear written boldly in his body language. "Just keep quiet!" he muttered tensely. Leaning in to speak directly beside her ear. His breath ghosting across her skin.

"Stop that!" Annabeth snuffed as she rubbed her ear. "I'm ticklish."

"This isn't a game!"

"I am very well aware!" Annabeth snapped as quietly as possible. "Although I have no idea what the fudgity fit is the matter and why persay it is a problem in the first place!"

"There are people over there!" Percy growled quietly. "And I don't want them coming over here!"

Now Annabeth could see why Percy was so upset. Why he pounced on her when she started to make a noise. People could mean the end of his life.

Annabeth's wings started trembling. The feathers sticking to the bark like velcro. Cautiously she twisted around and peeked her head out from behind the thick tree. Straining her eyes into the endless forest before she spotted a figure wearing an obnoxiously yellow shirt quite a ways away. A few other morphing shapes confirmed that said person was not alone.

Annabeth huffed. "Those are just some teens probably getting high off their rocker. Nothing to worry about."

"And what if those 'high' teens come meandering over here? What if they see me?!" Percy's grip on her wrist intensified. A skittish look darting into his eyes.

"So? Just pretend to be the angel of death or something. That oughta scare the suckers right out of there drugs."

"Stop joking."

"I'm not." Annabeth deadpanned. Meeting his eyes intensely as she wrenched her wrist from his hand and placed them on his chest in a soothing manner. "Those guys mean nothing. You'll be fine. I promise."

"You can't promise that." Percy hissed. His eyes flickering back around the tree every few seconds. "Just shut up until it's clear, would you?"

Annabeth squirmed against him anyways. "Would you please refrain from squishing me?" she complained quietly. "My wings are squashed."

"Shh."

"Eyuck! When's the last time you bathed!" Annabeth recoiled when she took an untimely whiff. Revulsion mixed in with her words.

Percy rolled his eyes and sighed in somewhat defeat. "If I stop squishing you, will you absolutely promise to not make a sound or move into the line of sight of those guys?" Percy bartered with a pinch in his brow. His green eyes searching hers with a determined hardness.

Kinda looked cute that way, but not the point.

"What does it matter if they spy me? You're the one with the gargantuan wings here!" Annabeth protested. Feeling challenged and ready to walk straight up to the druggies to prove her point to Percy.

"Right, like some teenaged guys *wouldn't* be lured to come running over here if they spotted a gorgeous girl alone in the woods." Percy retorted with a sarcastic ring.

Any witty reply was sucked from her mouth. A prickly sensation took over her cheeks as her face heated to the point of boiling. Her pulse jumping sporadically in her chest as she suddenly felt very aware of exactly how close they were. How their bodies were centimeters away. Annabeth sandwiched between Percy and a tree.

Percy's eyebrows suddenly dipped as he looked at her cluelessly. "Wait, why is your heartbeat so fast now?" he asked like he really didn't know the answer.

"You can't just call a girl gorgeous out of the blue and not expect at least the slightest reaction!" Annabeth wheezed. Her hands tightly folding over her chest. Cursing her hot cheeks and red face. How her blood pounded in her ears.

Sure, she'd been hit on before. Catcalled from across the street by disgusting men and sidled up to by cocky boys. She just never expected such an off the grid remark. It didn't sound like he was trying to hit on or flirt with her. He sounded totally indifferent. Like he was stating a fact rather than a compliment. And it made her heart go crazy for some strange reason.

Percy looked confused. "But you are…" he stated slowly. Still on guard against the people in the distance. Annabeth's breath jumped.

"Percy, when a guy calls a girl 'gorgeous' he is most often, usually trying to woo her, or gain her affection! It just startled me, okay? I wasn't expecting such a comment at a time like this."

Percy paled momentarily as he stared at her in shock. His wings quivering slightly as if he were ready to take flight.

Suddenly a blush burst onto his face, engulfing his cheeks as he hung his head in embarrassment.

"Cripe! I'm sorry! I didn't mean it that way." he murmured in a very apologetic tone. "I'm not used to standard social ways anymore. Heck, I grew up on a bloody farm so isolated that I only had one good friend. I don't know what's socially acceptable and what's not nowadays, I'm just so-"

"Percy." Annabeth interrupted his ramblings.

"Ya?"

"It's fine. Forget it ever occurred."

"O-okay."

"Are the people still lingering?" Annabeth poked him impatiently. Thankful that the colour in her face had dropped down considerably as she changed subjects. Leaving the faintest tingling sensation in her skin.

Percy craned his neck once more. The tension in his chest releasing when he looked back her. Eyes dancing slightly. "Their leaving. Heading towards the glade."

"Good." Annabeth pointedly pushed Percy off of her so she could scoop up all the bags she had dropped.

"Here, carry these up." she commanded as she plopped them into his hesitant hands. The plastic shushing as it moved. "I noticed you needed some new clothes, and I brought some food along."

Percy stared at the bags dumbfounded. Swallowing as if he were about to say something but never uttering a word.

"Go on." Annabeth urged. "Up ya go. I'll be there in two shakes."

Percy shot her an appreciative smile that stuck her breath to her throat. Dazzled at how this seemed to be the first time he actually genuinely smiled at her.

Than in a mighty flap he was gone.

And Annabeth was left to fight tooth and claw up the tree. Yanking at branches and ignoring the summer breeze. Pausing a few times to realigned her footing or to catch her breath.

By the time she had entered into the shoddy little tree house, Percy had already opened one bag of clothes and was frowning deeply at the panda hoodie.

"I do not approve." he muttered as he raised a skeptical eyebrow at her. "Ears should not be on hoods."

"And giant wings shouldn't exist." Annabeth insisted as she straightened her blouse. Keeping her white wings elegantly tucked. "Yet here we are."

Percy rolled his eyes and folded up the hoodie. Laying it gently back inside the back as he packed the rest of the things away.

"Where's the food?" Annabeth inquired. "I'm famished, and I purchased two meals so you don't have to share."

"You don't have to do this you know." Percy mumbled lowly. Staring at the charred circle of the empty fire pit. The only light spilling from the measly opening with its garbage bag flap pinned up. "There are plenty of berries, and nuts in the woods. Plus I know how to catch fish and rabbits and pheasants. Roots are a little tricky at times, but they work too."

Annabeth clucked her tongue at him as she settled her hands on her hips. "Tough luck Flyboy. I graciously brought you delightful edible supplies and you better eat it. Furthermore I'm not going to stop bringing you food. That's a ridiculous notion. So grab those bags and get them over here. If I didn't say it loud enough the first time, I should repeat myself. I'm famished."

Gratefully, Percy nodded and turned to grab the diner plastic bags. Stooping over to pick them up.

To Annabeth's shock, she got a good look at his back for the first time that day. Gaping at the horrendous slash that stretched diagonally across his shoulder blades and was caked in crusty dry blood. The rusty brown colour bringing bile to her throat as her eyes raked across the cut. His black tee shirt spliced adjacently with the dry wound, signifying that it didn't happen oh so long ago.

"Dear Lord Percy." Annabeth gasped. Horror strickening her voice. "What happened to your back?"

Percy stiffened. The takeout bags falling to the ground again as he wheeled around at her as if to hide the wound.

"I've seen it you dolt." She cussed him. An anger throbbing in in her chest. "Just tell me what happened."

Percy's fists tightened. A defiant burning look invading his eyes. For a moment all he did was stare at the uneven wall of logs. Looking as if he were never going to say a word again.

"They found me." He muttered miserably. His wings drooping in response to his emotions. "It's why I was so on edge about those teens. Whoever wants me dead knows that I'm in these woods. They shot at me. They almost killed me."

Annabeth's head started to spin.
