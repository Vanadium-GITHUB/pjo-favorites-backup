<strong>
This chapter was relatively easy to write because I've been a waitress at an afternoon tea before. (And it is fancy shmancy!) So yeah, enjoy.

### Chapter 8
"Behave well, and I just might forget about your little incident last evening." Athena was checking her makeup in her pocket mirror. Dabbing at her face elegantly even though her makeup had been poked at to perfection. How she was able to make a positive difference as they road down the bumpy road as a wonder to Annabeth.

"Yes, mother." Annabeth replied obediently. "I'll try."

"I'm glad. I'd be very troubled indeed if you were to embarrass me infront of Clarice." Athena continued. This time prodding at her intricate deep purple chapeau. Trying to get it at that prime angle for afternoon tea apparently.

Annabeth sighed and felt the needless stabbing sensation of her own useless hat. It was a delicate and pretty thing with looping exotic blue bird feathers and satiny curled ribbons. The white fabric of the hat matched the birdcage veil that obscured half of her vision and yet the whole hat barely covered half her head and was painfully pinned on an angle.

*Useless ass wings.* Annabeth sighed to herself as she stared through the veil at her hands. Hating her entire outfit head to toe but not daring to breath a word of it to her mother.

*I'll make her proud.* She decided quietly while stealing a glance at her mother. *She won't be disappointed of me any more.*

"You do look lovely." the soft spoken words shocked Annabeth to the bones. In utter surprise she looked up at her mother who had a pleasant smile on her ruby lips. "Blue really is your colour. It sets off the gold in your hair."

Warmth enveloped Annabeth's heart as she held her breath. "Thanks." was all she was able to choke out. Bursts of happiness pouring from her heart at the one compliment.

In one sweep, Annabeth looked over her outfit again. Remembering how critical she was of the white knee length dress with stretching blue flowers on it. Hating the short cropped sleeves and the general poofiness of the dress. Hating how she had to wear heels with it, and how her hands were enslaved in a elegant white gloves that buttoned on the wrist.

But now it seemed worth it. Even sitting through her mom's chastising as she applied the natural makeup to Annabeth's face seemed worth it. Even the tortuous hour it took to bind Annabeth's hair up in a braided woven bun was worth it. It was all worth it for that one simple compliment.

Athena hardly gave out compliments.

They were hard deserved.

"Would you ladies like for me to turn up the air conditioning?" the chauffeur's husky voice asked over the speakers.

"Oh yes." Athena replied in a heartbeat. Probably scared that the humidity would wreck all her hard work. "That would be marvelous. Thank you."

The limo driver gave a slight nod from the front cab, and soon they were enveloped in a gentle flow of cool air. Altering the temperature from a slightly uncomfortable warmth to the perfect in between.

"It was very generous for Mrs. Aresto to send a limo for us." Annabeth commented lightly. Hoping that she'd please her mother even more.

Athena nodded while putting away her pocket mirror into her clutch while simultaneously smoothing down her slimming purple dress. "Clarice is of the generous nature. I'm certainly not surprised."

And just like that the conversation died. Leaving Annabeth to stare at the long luxurious leather seats of the limo and wonder if she should've said anything at all. Soon the entire matter was forgotten however when her thoughts drifted over the country landscape they were crossing. Passing barren fields of dirt, or stubby shoots of the new crops. Old stone houses with red shingles and long gravel driveways loomed past every once and awhile looking antique but pretty. Plus the cloudless sky was promising a very beautiful evening.

An evening wasted. Annabeth stressed silently. Hope this doesn't take too long.

Percy was probably starving. With those stitches in he couldn't fly, and Annabeth had only left a box of cold onion rings thinking that she'd be back there the next night like normal.

*If that idiot tries foraging for food while he's in that condition, I'll kill em.*

Annabeth's attention was snapped when the driver suddenly slowed the car. Her eyes finding the magnificent mansion in a heartbeat.

The massive building was pure white and just creeping with Ivy. Each fancy curved window were elegantly framed, and the grand front entrance had a giant roman columns that just screamed *the homeowners are rich!*

Besides the grey stone u shaped driveway lined with well managed spiraled shrubberies, there was a giant marble fountain spewing sparkling droplets of water into the air that raced down its ornately carved tiers.

Annabeth couldn't hold back her low whistle. This place was the definition of class and wealth. Every detail of every area was taken care of to perfection.

"A lady does not whistle Annabeth." Athena's descending tone appeared. Her harsh look formed a sinking feeling in Annabeth's gut as she bowed her head shamefully.

"Sorry mother." she offered meekly. "I was only stunned at the beauty of this house."

"As you should be." Athena sighed. "But please refrain from showing your amazement in such an unprecedented manner."

"Yes Mother."

*Did it again dumbass.*

The limo pulled around to the front of the building smoothly. With a gentle stop, the door was opened by a gentleman waiting on the side and Annabeth followed her mother out of the limo, into the sunshine.

"Athena!"

"Clarice!"

A dark brunette woman with her hair piled high on her head came floating down the steps with a mesmerizingly flowy red dress that trembled lightly in the breeze. Her smile so wide, Annabeth was concerned her cheeks might break. Instantly the two ladies clasped each other in a joyful hug that left Annabeth standing awkwardly next to what she was 89% sure was the butler.

"It's been too long!" apparently Mrs. Aresto cried. "I'm sorry I didn't invite you out to Darbornise any time between these long years!"

"It's very well that you didn't." Annabeth's mother sighed with a ghost smile. "I've been dreadfully busy, and I'm afraid that even if you did invite me I shouldn't have been able to make the trip!"

"Well as a working single mother I'm not surprised." Mrs. Aresto moved away from the hug to clasp Athena's hands sympathetically. "I don't know how you do it!"

"I wouldn't have, if not for your kindness." Athena gratefully added.

"I would do it again in a heartbeat!" Clarice declared. Turning gracefully to link arms with Athena.

Annabeth supposed that's when her mother's dear old friend caught sight of her. The slim, bright eyed woman stopped in her tracks and put a surprised yet humble hand over her mouth.

"Athena!" she gasped while looking at her friend once more in utter surprise. "This can't be Annabeth, can it?"

Annabeth felt like nothing less than a bug under a microscope as the two ladies turned to look at her. Even the butler seemed to be staring at some extent.

*What should I do?* She panicked. Trying not to show it in any way. *What should I do? What would mom want me to do?*

With a tight chest, Annabeth bowed her head elegantly as she curtsied. Keeping her shoulders even and her movements light.

"It's a pleasure to meet you Mrs. Aresto."

Head high!

Shoulders down!

Keep your gut in!

Remember to smile!

*DON'T SMILE LIKE A CREEP! A SWEET SMILE! THINK OF SWEET THINGS!*

It was a struggle, but Annabeth managed to pull it off. Sighing enterally when Mrs. Aresto took her hand and shook it lightly as if she couldn't believe her eyes. Annabeth was just thankful that their hostess couldn't feel the sweat in her gloves.

"You've grown into such a beautiful young lady!" Mrs. Aresto beamed. "I remember when you were just a wee thing!"

"Thank you." Annabeth smiled as naturally as she could.

*SHOULDERS DOWN! WHAT ARE YOU? THE HUNCH BACK OF NOTRE DAME?*

Her head screamed at every imperfection she thought she was doing. So caught up in her posture that she never noticed how impressive the fields surrounding them were. How green the grass was, and how wonderfully the birds sang.

"Shall we take this party inside? I'm sure, Athena, that you are more than eager to see how my son has grown." A bit of humor seemed to be lingering in her voice for a reason Annabeth couldn't determine.

"Quite Eager." Athena chuckled with a devious glint in her eye.

She chuckled.

It was terrifying. Athena never *chuckled*. She hardly ever laughed. Yet here she was, reduced to the behaviour of a smug school girl. For what reason, Annabeth couldn't figure out for the life of her.

"Come Annabeth." her mother called as they made their way up the marble stairway to the giant doors. Their heels clicking against the hard polished stone.

*Follow two paces behind and one to the right.* Annabeth remembered her training with a bitter taste in her mouth. Sour memories of hours spent with books on her head and a pole against her back.

'Again!' Her teacher would bark. 'You are to make your family proud! Not to shame them with your clumsy ways!'

It was the reason Annabeth could talk, walk, and act like a gentle lady. Those brutal hours spent under her harsh teachers control. Never straight enough, never graceful enough, never smooth enough, never ever enough!

"I've decided that afternoon tea will be served in the garden today if that pleases you Athena. You see, I thought it was such a gorgeous day that it shan't be wasted!" Mrs. Aresto declared while they entered the mind boggling large entrance hall. A gold and crystal vining chandelier above two curved staircases opposite each other stunned Annabeth momentarily. The polished marble floor held her muted reflection and quiet awe.

"I agree full heartedly Clarice." Athena answered. "Besides your gardens, as I recall, are the loveliest in the country."

Mrs. Aresto let loose a hearty laugh that sounded as fake as a automated bird cry.

"Oh Athena! You flatter me so!"

What was this place? This way of living? It all seemed so surreal. So fake, and plastic. Every move was orchestrated, every detail of the house was managed and well cared for. It was as if this was the stage, and Annabeth was the puppet. Dancing on strings that didn't belong to her. Trying to think, trying to make sense of what she was doing but not being able to.

Annabeth felt like she was in a fog. Twirling between the lines of reality and a dream. How perfect her surroundings were. How perfect her Mother and Mrs. Aresto interacted. How perfect even the air felt on her lungs. It was a play, a movie, a performance. Not reality.

*This is the environment my Mother grew up in.* Annabeth reminded herself. Drinking in the world she seemed to have fallen into. *Unless I'm able to duplicate myself into a perfect high class lady, I'll never be perfect in Mom's eyes.*

As Annabeth's mother and Clarice continued chatting, they wove around a very well furnished house equipped with many servants until they came upon a pair of crystal glass double doors that Mrs. Aresto opened for them to show off the huge stone tiled Veranda overlooking the colourful garden.

While the veranda had a setting of modern garden lounges and a bar, it did not have any tea apparel on it which confused Annabeth for a second. But, the happy pair ahead of her just kept walking so she had nothing more to do but follow as elegantly as possible.

*These people must be absolutely filthy rich.* Annabeth noted as she was led down a flight of stairs and into a large lawn. Not a weed amongst the perfectly pruned blades of grass.

They followed a stone walkway hemmed with perfect square hedges and sprouts of glorious lilies. Passing a odd marble statue with no head, and finally arriving at their apparent, and perfect afternoon tea location.

Annabeth wasn't surprised that it was perfect. Everything was. This just seemed to rise a level above perfect. A white trimmed peaked glass gazebo? What's more perfect than that?

How about putting that glass gazebo beside a perfect water lily filled pond that had a an intricate arching bridge framing the other side. How about adding rings of colourful tulips thickly around the base of the structure. How about adding a tall, and majestic weeping willow right beside your already perfect glass gazebo. How about inviting pure white swans to trumpet and dance through the water beside the gazebo.

That's how picture perfect it was. That's how elegant the whole thing was.

*This was the world my mother grew up in.* Annabeth had to remind herself.

Guess what the table setting was? Perfect. That's right. It was all freaking perfect. Shining sterling silver stirring spoons, and curved forks and straight knives. Antique handpainted china teacups on matching saucers and dessert plates. Napkins folded into delicate cranes, and the white linen that flowed over the edge of the table beautifully. A three tiered silver cake plate stand lined with doilies and filled from bottom up with; uniquely shaped tea sandwiches, cakes and tarts, and finally scones, jams and clotted creams. Their names elegantly printed onto little place setting cards.

Mrs. Aresto, like a good hostess, went around and helped them into their chairs. Chatting the whole time about her days spent in the big city.

"I much prefer it out here." she revealed as she settled herself into her own comfortable chair. "So does my dear husband. But his work maintaining the hospitals often requires him to be in the city. Shall I ring for Wilson to bring us the tea?"

*Shoulders back, legs crossed at the ankles, head high, keep your hands folded in your lap dumbass.*

Annabeth only nodded politely as she lay her napkin on her lap. Hiding how her heels were killing her toes, and how her chapeau was making her head itch like mad. She wanted to rip that stupid bird cage veil away from her eye and was dying to remove her gloves to relief some of the heat but dared not to anything that would displease her mother.

"Good." Mrs. Aresto smiled as she brought her phone out of her clutch. Typing in a few things before returning her undivided attention at her guests. Or more specifically, Annabeth.

"If I remember correctly, you should be around seventeen." their host smiled sweetly at Annabeth. Her row of white teeth shining brilliantly.

"Yes."

"Oh, so you're about to graduate, isn't that right dear?" Mrs. Aresto's eyes were twinkling with excitement. As if anything that came out of Annabeth's mouth would be the most interesting thing ever.

"Yes."

"She's the top of her class." Athena interjected with some pride hidden in her voice, making Annabeth's heart swell.

"Is that so!" Mrs. Aresto exclaimed. Such a energized person. "My my, you have the brains of your mother! Now, I don't suppose you play any instruments?" she questioned. Peaking a perfect eyebrow up in curiosity.

"I play the piano." Annabeth said smoothly.

*Tones even! Keep your voice smooth, calm, and always always sweet.* Her brain was chastising those last words.

"I also play the harp." she managed to add with that silky tone her teacher taught her to strive for.

"What an accomplished girl you have Athena." Clarice gushed.

Although she was always excited, always happy, Mrs. Aresto still had her spine straight and always moved in a graceful manner. She was poised, but was able to add her own personality to it so it worked.

"Ah, Here's Wilson." Mrs. Aresto smiled gratefully to her well coated butler as he set a rose painted china teapot down on a plate. Steam rising slowly from it curved stout

Mrs. Aresto got up to serve. Her red dress flowing with her as she moved in perfect fluid steps.

"Sugar and Cream Annabeth?" she offered as the piping hot tea was set in front of her.

"Cream please. Thank you Mrs. Aresto." Annabeth nodded to her in gratitude. Voice as smooth, and as soft as newly washed feathers.

Annabeth didn't like tea. For all the times she had tea, she hated it. She hated the way it tasted, and looked. She hated how it was glorified among the upper class. And yet she drank it every time she was offered it. She drank it, and kept her mouth shut and her mask on.

*A lady does not drink because she is thirsty or eat because she is hungry. She accepts what her hosts gives her as acceptance to their hospitality.*

For the majority of the time remaining, Annabeth ended up listening to her Mom talk to Mrs. Aresto. Their conversation moving from types of wines, to their childhood days, to what their old nannies were like, what types of dogs their families kept.

Annabeth was only glad to be able to take off her gloves and indulge in some of the expensively made delights laid out. Making sure to sip her tea with one finger hooked through the handle, and stirring forwards, backwards instead of around when she was poured a new cup.

"Well if this isn't a merry scene if I ever saw one." a voice interrupted the party from the entrance of the Gazebo.

Annabeth thanked her stars that she didn't jump with a start, and was able to turn gently towards the source of the voice.

"Three gorgeous ladies enjoying a pleasant afternoon." the voice wasn't high, but wasn't exactly low. In Annabeth's personal opinion, the voice sounded as if it would belong to a llama if llama's could talk.

The guy talking, in fact, could've been a talking llama.

He was very pale. His skin smooth but pasty in complexion. His hair was a washed out blonde, and was heavily greased and parted to one side. Even his eyes were a pale blue. It was almost as if all colour from this boy had been stolen away in the night. To make up for his lack of colour, he seemed to have chosen to wear a vivid blue polo shirt and a pair of brown slacks that made him look even whiter in comparison.

Height was on his side but very thin, giving him a stick like structure that made him seem as fragile as the teacups on the saucers. It didn't help that his wings were stocky gull shaped wings with patches of mottled brown thrown in here and there.

"Ah, you must be Mrs. Chase." he exclaimed pleasantly while sliding his casual hand out of his pocket and offering it to Annabeth's mother. "I've heard many great things about you."

"Octavian!" Athena smiled broadly while shaking his hand. "Why you must've been only three when I last had the pleasure of seeing you."

"Well I have grown since then." Octavian chuckled warmly. "After all, I'm twenty now."

"And such a gentleman." Annabeth's mom complimented immediately, sending a jab of jealousy through Annabeth's heart.

Smiling, Octavian turned directly towards Annabeth with a sparkle lighting up his eyes. "Well if you'll excuse me, there's one person present whom I'm not acquainted with but should very much like to know." His movements were solid as he strolled around the tea table. Eyes never leaving Annabeth for an unnerving moment.

"Allow me to introduce myself." he started out with a very confident smile. "My names Octavian Aresto."

With a lump in her throat, Annabeth held off for a second. Knowing how this played out, knowing that he'd take her hand and kiss it. Well she wasn't so sure she wanted her hand to be kissed by this guy. But she knew she must get it over with to please her mother. She had to.

"Pleasure to meet you Octavian." she pronounced each word with grace. "My name's Annabeth Chase."

Then she offered her hand, hoping he'd do a simple handshake. But as any well educated higher class boy, he kissed her hand. Maybe for a little too long but that could be overlooked.

"Annabeth." he repeated. "What a lovely name for one of the loveliest girls I've ever seen."

Annabeth fought to keep her wings from fluttering nervously from their folded position. Caught off guard from his sudden compliment.

*How do I answer to that? What do I say?*

"Why thank you." Annabeth started hating how fake her words sounded. How she would never say these things. "You're very kind."

"Annabeth." Mrs. Aresto gently stood and placed the napkin from her lap on the table. "Seeing as afternoon tea is practically over, and your mother and I would like to chat a bit longer, would you like Octavian to show you his trophy room? I'm sure he would be more than happy to give you a tour."

No, she didn't want to see a room full of dead animals. She didn't want to hear Octavian brag about how he killed each and everything in that room.

"I would be delighted." she answered sweetly. Allowing Octavian to pull the chair away from her as she stood and taking the arm he offered her.

"Oh grande." Mrs. Aresto beamed again. "I'll send Wilson to fetch you once you're mother wishes to leave."

-{:oOo:}-

The trophy room was exactly what you'd expect. Heads of animals stuffed and stuck on wooden plates. Some creatures being completely stuffed and standing in menacing positions.

The room itself was dark wood walled with high ceilings and giant paneled glass windows that were heavily draped. Thick persian carpets with loose tassels splayed across the deep oak wood floors along with a few assorted animal hides.

Octavian was paragraph deep talking about a Grizzly that was standing on its hind legs in the corner. It's teeth bared and paws aimed to strike.

"Took a full month to bring down this big boy." he explained while patting the arm of the dead thing. "Landed two bullets to his paw. It was only a matter of time until he bled out."

*What a cruel thing to do. Injure the poor creature and then wait for it to die a painful death rather than putting it out of it's misery.*

Annabeth was finding less and less to say and more and more reasons to dislike Octavian.

She'd already seen his different types of wolves, and game birds such as quails, ducks, and geese. Each animal they observed she'd ask a question out of formality on how it was taken down, when really she was repulsed by how inhumanely half these animals left this world.

"Now this little thing was one of my first kills." Octavian boasted as he led her over to a glass case with a Raccoon frozen mid growl inside.

*The poor thing looks just like Bandit.* Annabeth cried silently.

"Wilson left the trash on the porch one night accidently. Sneaking into our rubbish was one of the last things he did." Octavian chuckled.

"Marvelous." Annabeth added with the fakest smile she'd ever put on. "And you were how old when this creature met his doom?" her unimpressed tone was slipping through, although Octavian didn't seem to notice at all.

"Ten." he declared proudly.

*Who trusts their ten year old with a gun?* Annabeth wondered.

"Is that a rhino?" Annabeth's eyes caught on something unnerving. The grey beast of a creature had its head bowed as if it were grazing with its proud horns arching towards the sky. It's armor was still majestic even though the poor thing had long since passed.

"Why yes, yes it is." Octavion looped an unwelcome arm around her waist as he guided her to the creature.

*Why this filthy handed creep.* Annabeth cursed. Wishing she could slap him across his rich boy's face.

"Aren't Rhino's endangered?" Annabeth asked innocently with a hidden message in her silky tone.

"Why yes. It made the hunt twice as hard. But it was all worth it in the end."

*WORTH IT!?*

"How fascinating." Annabeth opted on saying as she brushed her fingers over the carcass of the stuffed animal. Doubting she'd be able to hold out for much longer with this fake perfect voice.

"Isn't it! I do say it was one of the most exciting hunts I've been on. I've been contemplating on going back and getting a second Rhino for my dressing room. It would make a bloody good watch holder, that horn it has."

*Why you dirty son of a half nut. I oughta kick you right where the sun don't shine, and then stuff ya and turn you into a thrift store mannequin!*

Octavian took her silence as artful contemplation and waved his hand down the length of the room to perhaps interest her in other specimens. "My big cat collection is this way. Or perhaps you want to see my horned beasts?"

*Neither. I want to see neither of those. I want to leave. I need to make sure Percy is okay.*

"Well, I'll leave you to decide." Annabeth smiled delicately. Turning towards him so his hand would slide a little off her waist. "What is the most unique thing you've ever taken down?"

Her own words tasted disgusting. Why was she putting up with this? Why didn't she just go?

*For mom. Mom will be proud. She has to be.*

"Most unique thing?" Octavian paused to stroke his chin. Then with a quick smile, his arm fell back onto her waist, and his hand dipped a bit too low for comfort. Annabeth bit back the urge to struggle out of his grip.

"If you would be so kind as to follow me." he said a little flirtatiously.

Annabeth had no choice but to follow as he led her to one of the heavy oak doors to the room. Stopping in front of a smaller pedestal with a rigid form on its top.

Annabeth couldn't hold in a gasp as she realized just what it was. A dog. A white and brown spotted pointer with its long nose extended and its curved tail held high.

"This was Hank." Octavian commented nonchalantly as if it were no big deal that he had a pet dog in his trophy room. "He got in the way one too many times while we were hunting quails, and that was it for the old boy."

"Oh the poor thing." Annabeth couldn't hold it back. Besides, she was certain that Octavian must've felt some grief at accidentally shooting his own dog.

She was wrong.

"Poor thing? How come?"

"Why, he was accidently shot. If that doesn't deem the animal some sympathy I don't know what does." Annabeth explained simply. Trying to find some sympathetic emotion in Octavian's eyes.

She found no such thing.

"Accidently?! Oh no. Hank got in the way one too many times. A dog that botches the hunt has no place on the team. Besides, I had plenty of better pointers than he. Thought it would be humorous to add him to the trophy room though. I bet not many gentlemen have one of their own pointers stuffed and proud!" Octavian shrugged. Then upon seeing her slipped look of horror smiled apologetically. "But, I suppose since you are a girl, you wouldn't understand. Girls hearts are far too sensitive to comprehend the need of good hunting dogs."

"Perhaps I don't." The words burned to say with that smooth tone. Her brain feeling like it would burst. "Do you still keep dogs?" Annabeth tried to change the subject. Hoping that he didn't.

"Of course! In fact, I've been planning another hunting trip out in Mimoiyu. There's a lovely stretch of mountains that's home to the snow leopard. I bargain if I can get one of those in my trophy room, I'd have the most diverse collection in the entire country! My dogs are being specially trained for the trip. This hunt may prove to be one of the most challenging yet! But, I haven't met a beast that I haven't been able to slay before-"

"Pardon for intruding Mr. Aresto." The stiff butler appeared by the door. His gloved hands laying straight beside him as he stooped into a low bow. "But I have been sent to fetch Miss Annabeth Chase. Her car is waiting."

Relief washed over Annabeth like a cold bucket of water. In one dainty movement, she fell out of Octavian grasp and curtsied to him formally. "It's been a pleasure Octavian." she stated gently. "I hope we-"

"Oh, the pleasure has been all mine." Octavian grinned at her as he interrupted. "In fact, if you do not mind Miss Annabeth, I'd like to escort you to your car."

*No, I don't want you to escort me to my car. Not at all. I don't want to ever see you again.*

"I'd be delighted." she was barely able to get out in a decent way while taking his arm he was already eagerly offering her.

"It eases my mind, knowing that you arrived in one of our cars and shall be leaving that way." Octavian small talked as he led her through the house. "I daresay that women do not belong behind the wheel of any car. Why, in case of an accident what should she do if there were not a man around?"

*YOU UNHOLY SON OF A BASTARD. I SHOULD TRY AND MAKE YOU TRIP WHEN WE REACH THOSE BLOODY STAIRS.*

"Why yes. Cars are dreadfully dangerous I suppose." Her mask on and her figure as graceful as ever. She was an actress playing a role. She wasn't Annabeth, she wasn't the fiery rebel. She was a lady.

She was also more than thankful when the limo pulled away from the house. Hating every detail of it now as it faded into the distance.

"You were wonderful Annabeth." Her mother offered her a decent half smile. "I was very impressed."

"Thank you Mother." Annabeth tried not to squeal as a flower of happiness surrounded her heart. So happy that everything she had to put up with was well worth it. That she had done something right for once. And twice as happy that this was over. That she never had to go there again.

*If I want anything from her, I better ask while she's in a good mood!* Annabeth thought slyly. Thinking about what she had to do that night.

"Mother?" she started simply. Hoping that her wish would be granted.

"Yes?"

"Would it be alright for me to spent the night at Pipers? I did miss the entire writer's craft class today and I hope to get today's lesson from her." Annabeth crossed her fingers as she spoke. Knowing that Piper wasn't even in writer's craft.

"I guess that would be alright." her mother allowed. "But you leave after you've had a good dinner and you better not be late for school in the morning."

Annabeth's heart leapt as she laid out the plans.
