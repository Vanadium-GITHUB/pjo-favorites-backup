Forgotten Paradise Chappy is on its way soon! And this chapter totally spiraled out of control. I don't even know what's going on anymore lol.

### Chapter 11
"What's the matter?" Annabeth cringed when Percy cocked his head at her that way. His eyes soft and questioning as he sat on his throne of leaves and a scraggly sleeping bag. Wings folded majestically behind him. "You look a little off."

She thought he wouldn't notice anything different about her. She'd cleaned up awfully well. She even took a shower after her breakdown. Scrubbing all the makeup off and ridding herself of the stiff hairspray layered into her curls. It was dark as well. The only light skimming their faces shone from the hearty fire.

"Nevermind me." She waved him off. "Are you feeling any better? How's your back? Did I wake you up?" Annabeth set down her bag of stuff as per usual and gingerly made her way over the logs. Ignoring the black splintering scar that marred the other side of the fire like a painted shadow. Hating how seeing it gave a bad taste to her mouth and accentuated her feeling of failure as a person.

"It feels a bit hot but it's going down!" Percy stated almost excitedly. Tugging his shirt up to reveal the clumps of gauze taped to his skin.

Carefully, Annabeth peeked under the bandage. Her eyes gliding over the criss cross of messy stitches as she angled Percy carefully so that the firelight reached where she was looking.

"It definitely looks better" she acknowledged. His skin not bulging and inflamed around the wound. Instead a deep red still discolored the area, but that too would hopefully disappear as Percy healed.

"And my fevers gone. See?" Percy twisted around to suddenly grab her hand and bring it to his forehead. Grinning at her like a maniac at how he'd recovered. "I still feel a little dizzy from time to time though. But at least I have my energy back because I slept all day!"

*No personal space.* She chuckled to herself as she felt his forehead. Ignoring the soft locks of midnight hair tickling her fingers.

*Octavian also has no personal space…* Annabeth recalled with a jarring sensation. *But Percy's different somehow.*

Percy grabbed her hand again and brought it away from his head, the smile on his face and in his eyes dying. An intrigued suspicious expression morphing in its place as he searched her soft grey eyes. A slight frown on his lips and a grip on her hand that made Annabeth's heart race.

"Something's wrong." Percy stated seriously. The childlike glee melting off his figure as Percy returned to his usual self. Eyebrows furrowing in a gut wrenching way. "You've been crying."

Annabeth rolled her eyes convincingly. "What a preposterous thing to assume-"

"Why are you hiding it?" Percy interrupted her. Taking a demanding step forward to add to the intensive moment. His gleaming green eyes boring into her as she sputtered for another excuse. His grip on her hand tightening around her fingers.

"I just… You're… I… I've been dealing with a few minor things in my life. Okay?" she broke. Peeling her eyes away from Percy's to sulkily stare into the dancing fire. The emotions stirring up more tears which she fought back with hate. Her vision swimming.

*Pathetic. Failure.*

In a flurry of movement seconds later she was enveloped in a pair of strong arms and the feathery touch of wings. Shrouded from the light and buried in warmth and comfort as Percy crushed her in a hug. Overpowered with his deep salty smell and the soft tenderness of his grip. A hot blush creeping up her face and making her wings shudder with each hard fought for breath.

"What are you doing?" Annabeth asked breathless and timid against his shoulder. Wondering if he could feel how fast her heart was going. The beats thrumming through her veins at an unnatural pace.

"I… I don't know." Percy muttered dubiously. "It just felt right."

Annabeth chuckled nervously as she found her own arms winding their way around Percy's sturdy torso. Her chest feeling tight from nerves.

"I guess it does." she mumbled as she gave in. Soothed at how she could feel his own steady heartbeat under the fabric of his shirt.

Realizing only now how she had forgotten how good hugs felt. How they seemed to relieve her from her outside worries and problems and just wrap her up into a warm content little bundle. Feeling safe, and secure and how it made her feel *good enough*. She didn't have to be a perfect lady to get a hug.

She just had to be Annabeth.

"Wanna tell me what's going on?" Percy offered sweetly. "I hear it helps."

After a few seconds of soothing silence Annabeth sighed heavily. Her forehead resting on his shoulder in defeat. Trying her best to relax as her mind whirled with each and every problem that was weighing her down.

"It's just Mother." she sighed as she retracted from the hug. Percy's wings still coned around her like a black curtain of protection. "... or maybe it's just me." she changed her mind. Self doubt hitting her center and a stab of guilt for blaming her mother in the first place. The pressure of the day unrolling off her body as she relayed to Percy every detail of her troubles.

How perverted Octavian was. How she was so imperfect in her mother's eyes. The fact that she tried, and failed to be what she needed to be. The daily struggle of living up to her expectations.

It all just gushed out. One over the other while Percy nodded along. His facial expression morphing from serious to pissed to what-the-hec and then back to serious. Somewhere in the middle they meandered over to the pile of leaves and sleeping bag and sat down. Percy staying quiet nearly the whole rant.

"So ya." Annabeth finished off roughly. Pursing her lips to keep herself in check. "That's been my reality."

"Octavian sounds awful." Percy made a face. Twiddling with his hands and looking at her attentively. His mind working behind his eyes as he gazed at her. "But what I don't understand is why your Mom is trying to make you into something your not."

Annabeth cocked her head at him and brought her legs up to sit-cross legged. "She's not attempting to 'make me into something I'm not. She's just trying to make me a successful lady. She insists that I can, and there is no one wiser than my Mother. I'd be foolish not to at least try."

"Even if trying is breaking you to pieces?" Percy inquired as he raised an eyebrow. His enchanting eyes level with hers as he searched her intensely.

Annabeth's eyes fell to the space between them. Her tongue tied for an answer as she played with a loose string poking out of the navy sleeping bag.

"Oh hush, don't make it sound so dire. Mother's doing her best to raise me. If I'm not the person she longs for me to be then perhaps I am not trying my hardest." that hurt a touch to admit. Even if it wasn't necessarily true, Annabeth believed it.

*I must not be trying my hardest….*

The fire crackled heartily as Annabeth evaded Percy's perched eyebrow look. The expression on his features explaining how preposterous he thought that sounded.

"So you're pretty much willing to break yourself for this woman?" Percy scoffed. His dark eyebrows furrowing with a look of perplexity. "Excuse me for saying this, but that's dumb."

"I believe you've never met my Mother." Annabeth dismissed with a huff. Crossing her arms in defiance. "She sacrificed a great deal for my life. All her efforts have been to benefit me. Do you want me to just let her down?"

"She's your mom." Percy pointed out. "That's her job. To raise you. You act as if you owe her your life."

Annabeth deflated. Falling backwards on the makeshift bed and shooting Percy a sour look. Her heart aching terribly at the thought of how much of a burden she was.

"Maybe I do." she muttered. "You really must understand my mom in order to truly have a grip on this situation. She was never meant to work. She was promised a life as a stay at home mom. It all fell to pieces when my father died."

Percy leaned back to look at her curiously. No sympathy written in his features. Just a serious curiosity that glinted in his eyes.

"Your dad?"

"Car wreck." She answered quickly, averting her gaze to stare at the garbage bag and twig scrambled ceiling. Used to how the dialogue rolled off her tongue emotionlessly when people asked about her father. "I don't remember him very well. I was only four after all. The only one truly affected by his death was Mother. Since Father was the sole income for the family, she was left floundering with two children and no job experience. My mother grew up very wealthy, and had brung her parents honour by marrying into another family of money. Unfortunately, her parents died quite a bit before hand, and all of her inheritance had gone into improving my Father's multimillionaire company. The company deemed my Mother unfit to offer the job as CEO so a new person was chosen and she was left to drown."

Percy tapped his fingers against his leg. His wings shuffling slightly underneath him out of general discomfort to the hard surface. Annabeth avoided looking at this face awashed in firelight. Wondering to herself how she had begun spilling her family background like this. How Percy had gained her trust in such a short time.

"Didn't your mother have money saved in the bank?" Percy asked a little skeptically. Tilting his head in her direction quietly. A downward tug on his lips as the subject was obviously being scrutinized in his mind.

"Oh she did." Annabeth confirmed. "Enough to get by on for a couple of years in fact. But that was quickly drained by my Fathers rather stingy side of the family. Without any more money to her name, my mother was useless to them. So they pressured her into throwing an elaborate funeral for my father knowing she was mentally weak with loss at the time, and that it would financially ruin her."

"Your family tree is rampant with squirrels." Percy offered with a sigh after moment of quiet thought.

*That's all he has to say?!* Annabeth humphed to herself. *I might as well of said nothing.*

A dull silence creeped in shortly, and allowing them a moment to just watch dark shadows and drink in the moment. Annabeth was holding back a few pointed looks at Percy when he suddenly turned on his side to give her a puzzled expression. "So how did your mother get by?"

Annabeth smiled grimly and stared vacantly back up at the ceiling. Satisfied with his question in some odd way. Or perhaps, she was satisfied that Percy had more interest in her story than originally implied.

"That's apparently how the Aresto's got involved." Annabeth shrugged. "I don't know much about interaction myself, but I do know Clarice Aresto played a major part in my Mother getting back on her feet. Supposedly Mrs. Aresto gave my mother a large sum of money, and the Aresto family name as support to start her own business. My mother being the brilliant person she was soon was able to create a profitable business. Although things did get rough from time to time, she persevered through it all and overworked herself so that my brother and I could get a better education than most."

Annabeth subtly turned on her side to sneak a peek at Percy. Catching his thinking face as he looked up at the ceiling in quiet thought.

*What is he thinking?*

Percy turned to look at her, and was apparently momentarily startled by her already eager eyes. A light blush dusted his cheeks while he instantly averted his gaze.

Something Annabeth had never witnessed in him before.

"So your mother's had a bit of a rocky past. It happens to everyone! That still doesn't mean you owe her as much as you think." Percy kept his eyes glued to the ceiling. His voice hard and strong even though Annabeth could sense the slight tremor in his wings.

"You're showing to be quite a stubborn one." Annabeth sighed in exasperation. "I've already explained to you why I *do* greatly owe my mother. Why do you persist that I don't?"

"I guess I just don't think you owe her a thing." Percy shrugged. "And you shouldn't be ruining your happiness just for her sake."

Annabeth felt a twinge of distaste at this words. Anger starting to simmer at how he had so bluntly opposed her. She felt challenged at his words but decided to do the wise thing and suck it up.

"So I suppose we can agree to disagree?" Annabeth slanted an eyebrow at him. Wondering if he would pursue his side of the argument further. At this point though, it was obvious that neither of them would change their minds, so what was the point?

"Ya. Still think it's dumb tho."

"Still think you are unaware in what you share your opinion about." Annabeth nipped back playfully instead of icily.

Percy shot her an amused grin before he chuckled deeply. Annabeth's heart skipping at the sparkle in his eyes.

He didn't have that sparkle before. He'd only ever looked at her with a veil of hidden suspicion. A look of calculating flightiness like wolve determining whether to fight or flee.

"I've been meaning to ask you." Percy started seriously. Looking over to her with question heavy eyes. "Why is your compass so important to you?"

"In what circumstance did you assume that my compass had any value to me?" Annabeth asked in return. Evading his question subtly.

"Uh, maybe because you almost killed yourself falling out of a tree while trying to get it back." Percy pointed out with a *er duh* ring in his voice. His eyes never leaving her face.

Annabeth sighed heavily. Realizing she had been caught in a place she couldn't avoid to answer.

"It was a present." she muttered a bit sadly. "Given to me by a dear friend who… vanished."

"Vanished?" Percy asked with a shocked tone. His eyebrows knotting into a curious expression.

"Luke." Annabeth named. "Was a very close friend of mine right up to high school. We were friends since we were toddlers. Best friends in fact. A few months before he disappeared he kept talking about a secret. Some special super secret in which not even I could know about. Then one day he was gone. Nobody could find him, nobody knew where he went. All he left was this compass addressed to me. And that was that." Annabeth felt a few tears rise to her eyes. The memories she repressed of the smiling blonde haired boy flashing across her mind. Their adventures in the green strip, how he protected her from the street bullies and picked her up when she felt down. How she always saw him as her superhero. Now nothing more by a few fading memories.

"Do you think he's still alive?" Percy pondered quietly. Looking at her with those intense green eyes. Soft, and soothing yet inquisitive all the same.

Annabeth chuckled sadly. Remembering the look on the police officer's face as she tormented him with question after question about the investigation. "The police said it was a far shot that they would find him."

"Oh." Percy muttered. "I can see why the compass means so much to you."

Annabeth hummed in reply. The ache in her chest squeezing as more memories of Luke seeped in. It hurt to remember them. They were so close, they went through awful puberty together for crying out loud!

*Enough of this.* Annabeth sniffed to herself. *Let's change the spotlight here.*

"Alright." Annabeth decided on something as she rolled over onto her belly. Looking at Percy seriously in the process. "Enough about me and my insignificant petty problems and background, let's talk about your troubles."

"Your problems aren't petty." Percy huffed protectively.

"Oh hush." Annabeth chided. "Compared to you my problems are fluffy clouds floating dreamily in the sky. You've got the thunderstorms."

"But-"

"Thunderstorms." Annabeth interrupted his protest. "I don't mean to pry, but as being the sole person you have outside contact with, I suggest you get a few things off your chest. It may help."

Percy scowled childishly. "I don't have any other problems besides some psychos trying to kill me."

"Really?" Annabeth asked earnestly. Stretching her white wings out lazily to pop the joints. Her eyes stuck on Percy as she searched his expression with cat lidded eyes.

"Really." Percy persisted whilst glowering at the roof.

"You liar!" Annabeth accused suddenly. Feeling comfortable enough to smack him in the gut lightheartedly.

Percy doubled forward, caught off guard and groaning as he held his gut. Grimacing he shot her an unimpressed look. "Uhhhh hello? Abuse?"

"I don't take well to liars." Annabeth sniffed in defense with a small smile as Percy toppled backwards onto the leaf bed again.

"Evidently!" Percy snorted.

"So you admit it." Annabeth grinned at him devilishly. "You were fibbing."

"I was not-"

"So the loss of your best friend wasn't painful in the least? You were A-Okay with it?" Annabeth spoke quietly with a baffling sudden twist of seriousness. Knowing how evil her words were. How they would draw him out and force him to confess any long held in feelings.

But she couldn't help it. She had to draw him out, she had to! When she met Percy, he was just so emotionless and cold. He was weathered from life in the woods, and he was out of touch with his feelings from the pain he had suffered. He was like an armadillo curled into a tight hard ball with a thorn in it's belly. The only way the thorn could be removed was if he opened up instead of hiding the pain by himself.

She didn't want him suffering alone anymore.

"Of course it hurt when Grover..." Percy answered a little roughly. A darkness in his eyes as he refused to look at Annabeth. Perhaps a little anger in his words at how she was forcing him to talk. "I just don't want to talk about it…"

"Why not?"

"Because it hurts to talk about!" Percy huffed. Giving her the sourest look she'd ever received. His voice growing loud and defiant. "I don't want to think about what happened that day. At all!"

Annabeth let a moment of silence slip between them as she collected her thoughts. Percy's sudden outburst at her rattled her intentions. Momentarily, she questioned herself and if she was doing the right thing.

*My intentions and end goal is in the right place.* She determined thoughtfully. *I'm going about this all wrong however. Forcing words from one's mouth does not make one feel better.*

"I'm sorry." Annabeth offered meekly. "It was a mistake to say that, and to pursue the topic."

Percy didn't respond. Instead he glared at the ceiling and seemingly ignored her. His ruffled dark locks looking so toyable as his eyes held bittersweet memories.

"Just don't do it again." Percy muttered as he stumbled to his feet. That cold suspicious look coming back into his eyes again as his memories knotted barbed wire around his heart. Annabeth's gut twisting at the way she had caused this reaction in him.

How she had caused him to coil tighter into a painful little ball.

Darkly, Percy made his way over to the exit. His eyes hollow as he gazed out into the night. His black wings unfurling majestically as the firelight flickered off his back.

"What are you doing?" Annabeth asked fearfully.

"Just going for a little flight." He answered emotionlessly. Not even bothering to look at her.

"No!" Annabeth jumped to her feet and latched onto his arm. Determination in her grip as she held him back with a fire in her eyes. A sense of panic throbbing in her chest as she tried to prevent anymore damage her words had caused. "No, no. I understand! You're upset. You want to fly off your feelings. I'm sorry! But you can't fly! Your wound will rip right open again!"

Percy's form was rigid. His muscles tense beneath her fingertips. Frustration, anger and hatred at his pain was pulsing through his body. Annabeth could feel it.

Soothingly she pressed a palm against his chest and gently tried to edge him away from the exit. Her eyes locking with his as she met his riled look with one of a calm serene demand.

It had the opposite effect intended. Instead Percy seemed to grow more agitated. His hands curling into fists as his eyebrows bowed to a scrunched look of a total unsure anger. A shiver passed through his body before he took one hurried step away from her. Out of her reach.

Annabeth stood there with her heart in her throat. Wondering why Percy was acting like this. Why was he so riled up?

He looked terrifying like that. His broad shoulders taut, and his eyes dark. Shadows and firelight fighting over his body while his massive tar black wings etched only a frightening silhouette in the darkness.

"Dammit Annabeth." he swore breathily. Looking to the floor as if he couldn't bear to bring his eyes to her. "You have no idea how much you've confused me tonight."

Annabeth blinked. Trying piece together his words in a light that would make sense. Failing, she shot him a dubious look.

"I confuse you? What does that-"

"One minute I'm just angry at you for stupid life choices, but I can't be because you're just being you and your trying to help, and I didn't mean to miss you the other day but I did and dammit I don't know. I don't even know you that well." he babbled with a growing red on his face.

Annabeth stood there. Utterly and completely lost to Percy's babbles. Her head spinning with words, but like an owl city song, they didn't make any sense.

"What are you trying to say?" Annabeth questioned with concern hemming her voice. Taking a timid step forward as she wondered if his fever was back. Or perhaps the sickness had gone to his head. Shooting him a worried look Annabeth pursed her lips and ran through diseases Percy might've contracted.

"I just- you just- Dammit Annabeth. You just confuse my so bloody much!" Percy growled as he took a sudden step forward.

Annabeth stumbled back in alarm before Percy caught her. His arms yanking her close in one smooth movement. Her hands pressed to his chest when their bodies collided.

Two seconds later he was kissing her. Angry kissing her. His arms tightly crushed against her back, his lips moving against hers. A dash of bizarre tenderness in his movements.

Annabeth felt her stomach jump and skitter. A surprised mewl grew and died in her mouth as her eyes fluttered closed on instinct and her throat constricted. Her heart went wild, hammering through her chest and onto Percys. Her fingers twisting and grabbed fistfuls of his shirt as he kissed her harder. Her lungs feeling like they were going to explode.

She was shocked, and miffed and speechless and confused. Part of her was happy though. Part of her *wanted* it, that's what confused her the most. Part of her was was kissing him back for a few heart squeezing seconds. She didn't know why she was feeling this, she didn't know why she hadn't pushed him off her yet.

And that's when she understood his confusion.

Because she was now confused too. It had spread to her like a disease.

As soon as it had started, it was over. Percy jumped away from her like he finally realized exactly what he was doing. Eyes wide as they both stood there open mouthed and panting with red faces. Annabeth's eyes streaming question after question as she stared at him. Back pressed against the wall to steady herself as her heart still roared in her ears,

An apologetic guilt fell onto Percy's face. His eyes hitting the floor in shame. Before Annabeth could even summon the thinking power to talk, Percy had walked to the exit, unfurled his wings and disappeared into the night.

Leaving her thoughtless, and wordless. Her mind officially short circuited.

Numbly she left. Not collecting her bag, or her things. She just left. Tripping through the forest with a blank mind.

She was halfway home on her bike before she could even form a word. Zipping past town on her bike in the dead of night. Not even thinking of directions or turns.

*Why did he kiss me… why did I kiss him… Do I like him? Does he like me? Why?*

"Hey! Its that dame who called the cops on us!" A voice cried out as she passed a gas station. For a moment the voice snapped her out of the daze she was in.

"Screw off ya nasty ugly nose pickers!" she yelled over her shoulder before taking a turn.

*Why did he kiss me… why did I kiss him… do I like him? Does he like me? Why? Why? Why?*

-{:oOo:}-

"So how was dining with the Arestos?"

"Uh. fine… it was great." Annabeth muttered without thinking. Her mind on the night before. Far away from what Piper was talking about as they walked to school.

"It was great?!" Piper exclaimed in surprise. "But Octavian was supposedly such a pig!"

"Huh?" Annabeth finally tore herself out of it. "I'm sorry. What were we talking about?"

"Your formal dinner with the Aresto's last evening?" Piper raised an eyebrow at her. "You said it was great?"

"What?! No! It was terrible! Octavian was such creep like always." Annabeth proclaimed absolutely. Shivering at the idea of actually enjoying herself in such an environment.

Piper crossed her arms with a bizarre look on her face. A look that made Annabeth's skin crawl.

"Alright, spill." Piper huffed. "You've been nothing but distracted for the past week. What on earth has captured your attention so well that you can't even talk to me?"

Annabeth stared at the concrete sidewalk as it passed beneath them. Gingerly stepping over the cracks with care as if it would help her situation.

"Nothing." She tried to brush her off. The vivid memory of Percy's lips moving against hers suddenly coming to mind again like a badly timed pun. A blush creeping up onto her face as a result.

"Annabeth Chase, you have precisely two seconds to tell me what is going on." Piper waved her finger at her in a mothering way. "It's a friday after all. You should be thrilled."

Annabeth pretended to cave. "I'm just concerned. What if I don't do well on exams and am then rejected from attending Prescillion University?"

With fake concern in her eyes, Annabeth looked to Piper.

"There there my naive friend." Piper patted her with fake sympathy and a exasperated smile. "When you grow up, you will learn just how impossible that scenario is."

"Piiiiipes." Annabeth whined.

Piper only laughed as she scooped up a stone. Tossing it between her fingers expertly as always before she shot her a cheeky smile. "Don't worry about it Beth. You're the smartest girl in the school!"

As if it helped her point, Piper made a perfect solid throw and knocked another chip in the grisly wooden sign. Her smile broadening. "You'll be fine!"

Annabeth stood at the base of the stone work stairs to collect her thoughts.

*I'll be fine… I'll be fine… But what about that kiss? What am I supposed to make of it? Ouuhh I'm so conffuuused.*

Annabeth stared up a minute longer at the ancient stone work building and admiring the butt ugly gargoyles before she decided to shove aside her plaguing thoughts. Somberly, she dragged herself into the school.

-{:oOo:}-

"Mr. Chiron? Sir?" Annabeth had waited until after class to approach him. When the sun was slanting through the aged speckled glass and the sporadic whirring fans were put at ease. The last student leaving signifying that it was her time to ask.

"Yes Annabeth?" the wheelchair bound teacher looked up at her expectantly from behind his desk. His spectacles perched lightly on his nose, while papers were stacked in neat piles on his desk. For a moment, Annabeth chickened out of her odd question and thought that she might compliment his blue tie or old tweed suit instead. But with a burst of persistence she carried through.

"Why is it dangerous to ponder or daydream about flight?"

For a second Mr. Chiron's face remained neutral, but it quickly melted into a dark look. His bushy eyebrows furrowing as he looked at her in a calculating way.

"Why do you remain on the subject when I've warned you against it?" Mr. Chiron asked with none of his usual warmth in his voice.

"Can you blame me for being curious?" Annabeth inquired innocently. Folding her hands behind her back delicately as she kept her wings neatly tucked.

Mr. Chiron sighed heavily as he set his ink pen down. With precise movements, he plucked the spectacles off his nose and set them to the side. His time worn eyes meeting hers tiredly.

"I suppose not." he gave in. Weaving his hands together on his desk as if he were in for a long disciplinary talk.

"Annabeth, there are things in this world that you could never even dream to experience." Chiron started slowly.

"What kind of things?" Annabeth asked quietly. Not particularly liking the way Chiron seemed to age when she asked him about flight.

"Good and Bad things." Mr. Chiron clarified. "Dreaming about the impossible will not further your future. It'll only bring bad."

"What kind of bad?"

"If you could handle that answer, I would tell you." Mr. Chiron mumbled. "But for now I can only warn you. If you trust me on anything child, trust me on this. Daydreams are fine when you are young, but once you grow up you must abandon them. Now please refrain from bringing the subject up again."

Annabeth was going to protest. She wanted to know more, she wanted answers and reasons. Not vague words pasted together to form a shadowy warning. But the look of worn tiredness and desperation in Chiron's eyes made her hesitate. She had never seen that look before and she prayed she never would.

"I understand." she mumbled quietly instead. "Thank you Mr. Chiron."
