### Chapter 13
It was going to rain again. She could tell by the way the leaves rustled with giant puffs of wind, and how the clouds, dark and heavy, covered the sky like a thick tarp. The cool breeze was thick with moisture and heavy with promise of rain. It was refreshing, and helped cleared Annabeth's mind by a tad.

The trunks of trees where only think columns of shadows in the black night. So unclear and limited that she could barely see them and their rough edges.

But somehow she had made it to Percy's tree. Hesitating momentarily as she stared at the warm flickering firelight cascading out the peeps and cracks in the pile of logs and twigs forming the hut. Aghast that Percy was awake even at this ungodly hour. She had been hoping she could've just dropped the food off while he was asleep but no.

A heavy stone felt like it settled in her butterfly ridden stomach, and her breath seemed hard to grasp. She was so focused on *not* thinking about the kiss, that it was the only thing she *could* think about.

Percy's arms around her, and lips lively pressed against hers, her back to the wall and her heart in her throat. Her confusion and longing and just gah! It was enough to keep her blushing for hours.

Gripping the flimsy paper bag of fast food as she tried a final time to wipe the blush off her face. Cursing her wings for shuddering with each roaring thud of her heart.

*Screw up. Just get this over with.* She egged herself on. Mustering the courage to finally reach up and pathetically drag her windblown figure into the little hollow hut. Instantly being encased with the slightly uncomfortable heat from the fire.

Percy was sitting as usual on his little log by the licking flames. He didn't look surprised. He didn't even look embarrassed. All he gave her was a passing glance before returning his gaze to the fire. The serious expression engraved on his face was enough to make Annabeth reconsider coming up here.

"You're back." Was all he muttered quietly. His eyes never reaching up to meet hers.

"Of course I am." Annabeth retorted curtly. "I am not one to be hindered. Besides, how could I die with a guilty free conscious if I left a bum in the woods to die?"

Percy didn't say anything. He left a hollow space for that awkward silence Annabeth so dreaded to come creeping in and tickle her neck hairs. She hated it. She hated how the wind had more to say as it wove between the branches then they did. She hated how there was an underlying pressure for something to be said. She hated the stupid look on Percy's face as he refused to acknowledge her anymore then he already had.

Why was he the one who was ignoring her? He was the one who kissed her! He was the one who made this whole confusing mess in the first place!

Aggravated, and desperate for conversation, Annabeth chucked the paper bag of fast food at Percy with a little more swing in her arm then she meant. A bubble of frustration filling her chest in a tense manner as she released and watched it fly through the warm air.

Percy caught it in his arms only after it hit him in the head with a paper crumpling thud. His wings jolting from the surprise impact. His dark eyebrows turning down to look at her in confusion as he held the package of burger and onion rings in his arms.

"What the-"

"Consider it manna from heaven." Annabeth interrupted with a dead end expression and a voice to match.

"Thanks." he muttered as he unrolled the top and pulled out the food items one by one. Again, his eyes not going up to meet Annabeth. His tone only bordering friendly and thankful but more flippant than anything.

The next three minutes was Annabeth watching as Percy picked at a burger awkwardly. Not looking at her. Probably pretending that she wasn't there.

But for as much as she wanted to talk, and force him to talk, she could see his mounting discomfort. She was making him anxious and she knew it. The way he rubbed his neck every few seconds and how his eyes would flicker between his burger and the fire more and more frequently betrayed everything.

"Are you going to say anything? Or are you going to just sit there and watch me eat like a weirdo." Percy finally snapped. His eyes finally breaking away from his staring contest with a hunk of meat and bread to look at her with vexed undertone.

Surprisingly, Annabeth didn't blush and her wings didn't shiver. She thought she would, being face to face with this guy again but she wasn't.

"Excuse me if I'm too upfront, but I believe you are the one who has a bit of talking to do." Annabeth stated boldly. Her eyes set in a piercing stare. "You were the one to kiss me. Not the other way around."

That's what Percy was probably waiting for. He probably wanted her to bring up the topic first so he wouldn't force her into a conversation on it, because as soon as she said it his eyes fell and he wrapped up the burger again. His wings falling slightly.

"I'm sorry." Were the first words out of his mouth. "I- I don't know what came over me. I just… I…"

His voice faded. His hands turned the burger over and over in a nervous tick. Again he refused to look at her. Probably refused to accept that she was there in front of him asking for answers.

"Look." Annabeth sighed heavily. "I don't think, that kiss really truly meant anything at all."

Percy's eyes snapped up to hers. If he was upset or relieved, she couldn't tell. He had this knotted tenseness in his eyes that seemed to be drawing the light from them.

"I mean. I certainly don't harbor any romantic feelings towards you, and I'm quite positive that you don't to me either." Annabeth stated. Her fingers finding the rough edge of her spare book bag strap to fiddle with nervously.

Percy looked like he was going to protest for a second. His lips disappeared into a tight purse before he exhaled a little coarsely. "You don't know that." he mumbled.

"Know what?"

"That… That I don't… 'harbor feelings' for you." Percy looked away with a mellow gleam in his eyes. A blush deepening his cheeks as he adamantly stared at the wall.

A spasm of butterflies blossomed in Annabeth's stomach suddenly. Gritting her teeth she did everything possible to stab each little bugger out from making her feel like this.

"Yes I can." She persisted.

"Annabeth. I like you." It was hard and it was cold. His eyes swooping up to look at her defiantly with burning truth written in those green pools. With the firelight flickering against his figure and the tenseness in his body Annabeth had a hard time extinguishing the butterflies for a second time. Didn't help that her breath had left her.

"Not the friend kind of like you… I *like* like you."

"No." Was all that she was able to say. Her throat clenching up on itself as her mind rebelled against her.

"No?"

"No."

"...No."

The two stared at each other. Annabeth sending off heated vibes while Percy questioned her through those piercing yet searching eyes. She would never admit how much she actually adored those wild green eyes. Not even to herself.

"You do not 'like' me." Annabeth's hands curled into fists as she spoke. A slight quiver in her voice. "You admire the idea of me." She tried to explain.

"No." It was Percy's turn to defy. "I *like* you. I can't emphasize the *like* part of the enough."

"How is that even remotely possible." Annabeth questioned with an element of aggravation. "Percy. Listen to me. This, *this*, right here isn't anything. I'm the only person you've seen in over a year. I'm the only person you can interact with safely. Of *course* you're going to fabricate a romance with me. I'm the idea of what you could have if you were in normal day society. A romance with me, even a fake one would give you a sliver of normalcy, and you take comfort in that. So *no*, you are not in any way, case, or form falling for me. *You* are falling for the *idea* of me. The *idea* of normalcy."

Rant over Annabeth crossed her arms and looked at Percy carefully. Examining his now confused expression as his gaze shifted back over to the fire. Expecting some sort of response, expecting either total acceptance or clinging to denial.

"You really think that?" he asked instead. Perching his eyebrows up at her.

"Yes." Dammit she couldn't keep her heart steady when he looked at her like that. How was she supposed to have a civilized conversation?

*I'm only feeling this way because he kissed me.* She told herself. *Nothing more.*

"You're simply lying to yourself. You said it before that you were out of 'whack' since being out of civilization for so long."

Percy looked at his burger again. Slowly peeling off the wrapper thoughtfully. "Well, okay. I'll take your word for it." he spoke somberly. In Annabeth's opinion he didn't sound a smidget convinced but she wasn't about to continue arguing with him over it.

"Go on, eat up." she instructed like a last thought. "I didn't buy the blasted thing for you to just gaze at it adoringly all day."

Percy did. As he ate she delicately curved around him, remembering to mind the hazardous dips in the raw wood floor. Percy's head following her all the way around. That guarded uncertainty plaguing his eyes all over again like the first days she visited.

"What are you doing?" he finally asked warily with a mouthful of food. Angling his body towards her as if to protect his back. Acting as if she were about to penetrate a knife between his shoulder blades.

"You flew the other night. Might as well brought a blade to your own back by doing that bloody ridiculousness." Annabeth chastised as she stepped closer. "Now turn forward, I'm just going to have a look at your wound."

Percy tensed up as soon as her hand landed on his shoulder to push him slightly. She could see him swallow nervously as her fingers worked the fabric and buttons of his wing gaps. Ignoring how he seemed to pause eating just to focus solely on what she was doing.

*How on earth did I lose his trust like this?*

Pushing back the bandages, Annabeth was surprised to see the row of sloppy stitches still in place. In fact, new pink skin was starting to take it's hold on the edges of the wound.

"Looks good." she commented lightly. "It's healing extraordinarily fast."

Percy grunted something she didn't quite catch. Probably just a noise of relief. That or a bitten back sarcastic comment.

When Annabeth stepped away from him, Percy went on eating his burger like nothing happened. He wouldn't even look at her, his sole attention on nourishing himself apparently.

Dumbly Annabeth watched him finish. Well *watched* isn't the right term, it was more of her presence that made it seem awkward. Arms crossed tightly, and staring at her kilt and knee high socks in attempt to avoid catching his eyes.

When Percy was done, he balled up the trashed and mellowly brought his eyes up to hers. That wild unpredictable glint still shimmering in his green pools like the sharp reflection of a knife. That one piercing question still visible in his gaze.

*Why are you still here?*

It was as if he expected her to bolt like a frightened hare from a diving eagle. She couldn't figure out for the life of her why he was sending off this less than inviting vibe but it was seriously starting to peeve her off.

"Close your eyes. Open your mouth." Annabeth demanded suddenly. Remembering something that might help out with the mood of things.

"Wha?"

"Just do it."

"No."

"You think I have the indecency to shove some piece of rubbish in your open flapper then you're dead wrong. I have a surprise which I think you'll find quite pleasant so please by all means just do it." Annabeth dead panned. Shooting him what she hoped was the most withering look she could muster while pushing back the flap of her bag and reaching inside.

Percy just stared at her again. His eyes working like clockwork as if he were trying to perceive exactly what she was up to. The rugged look unnerving her surprisingly. Finally Percy sat back and closed his eyes with an exhale of irritation as he gave in.

When his mouth hesitantly opened she took the moment to wedge a soft chocolate chip blue cookie in it. A knot in her throat and a smile on her lips as she watched his eyes open in confusion. His fingers reaching up to grab at the cookie and pull it away. A chunk still left in his mouth as he bounced it around his tongue.

Finally realization seemed to dawn on his eyes, and his scrunched dark eyebrows shot skyward.

"These taste just like-"

"They are." Annabeth confirmed with a soft smile. "I saw her this afternoon."

Percy shot to his feet. His eyes searching hers almost desperately and his heavy wings springing up behind him causing the fire to flicker and hiss in dramatic movements.

"What?!"

"Keep your shirt on buckaroo." Annabeth barked while she held her hands up.

"How is she? Is she okay? Did she look sick? Did you tell her anything?" the questions poured out like water from a broken dam. Percy stepping closer, closer all the closer making Annabeth's heart pound and flip and do all sorts of circus tricks.

"She's fine." Annabeth soothed gently. "She misses you a great deal, but still well enough to make tea and carry on very decent conversation."

Percy's look of concern and intensity never left. His eyebrows still furrowed, his muscles still tense, and his eyes still burrowing into her.

"She's okay." Annabeth muttered again. Timidly reaching up a hand to place on his shoulder in a comforting manner. A shiver passed through Percy before his gaze fell and he stared quietly at the rest of the cookie in his hands. His black wings relaxing into a half folded position. Outside the first sheet of rain started beating against the hut like a thousand claps from a distant audience.

"What did you say? How did you even find her?" Percy persisted a little less aggressively. A almost lost tone in his voice.

"You gave me a street name and a general area. Took not but wit to find her." Annabeth shrugged. "And we talked about you. I told her I was researching missing people for a school assignment. She told me how you disappeared."

A second of silence ticked between them. The rain intensified. Waves of it rattling against the roof, and pit patting against trunks. Thunder growling lowly in the distance.

"That's it?" Percy muttered as he shifted to his other foot. His eyes flickering between the wood floor and her eyes every moment or so. The cookie now held between both hands as if it were too precious and delicate to lose.

"Well pretty much." Annabeth shrugged again, removing her hand gingerly to let it drop behind her back. "There may or may not be a government worker guy watching her every movement…."

"WHAT?!"

"Perce, calm dow-"

"You mean like a stalker? Someone is WATCHING her? You want me to be calm that someone is following my mother around?!" Percy paced back a few steps before swinging around to look at her again. His eyes holding that wild glint.

"Yes." Annabeth deadpanned. "I'm not done talking."

Percy cocked his head and crossed his arms as a bizarre 'I'm sorry, please continue' look. His eyes betraying exactly how fast his thoughts were moving. His patience at the world running desperately thin.

"Do you remember the night you were severely ill? I had to redress your bandages and it took eons to make you eat some damn stew?"

"What does this have to do with-"
"The night of the fire." Annabeth interrupted with an on edge tone. Her eyes matching in dominance. "Remember?"

Percy nodded mutely.

"Well." Deep breath. "I sort of ran into the men trying to kill you that night."

"You what?"

"Men in jeeps with guns scouring the forest with these powerful white lights. I was quite shocked to see them but there they were."

"You-"

"Anyways, I stopped and chatted with the ugly brutes. Then I called the cops to throw them momentarily off your trail. The man in charge, so it would seem, was this military cut eagle nosed chump whom I more affectionately referred to as 'flab face'. He was the one in front of your mother's house."

"He was-"

"There's more." Annabeth chastised. "I confronted him on your disappearance. I practically told him that I knew your disappearance was fishy and that you weren't dead. I will most likely be arrested in the morning."

Annabeth waited but her ears remained open.

No outburst. No booming interruptions. Percy just stared at her with his mouth slightly slack and his eyes searching hers again over and over to make sure this wasn't some sort of sick joke. The blood slowly draining from his face and giving him the complexion of a ghost.

"You… you what?" he murmured dumbstruck. His eyes falling as he relayed the information before shooting back up to look at her.

"Depends on tomorrow's news." Annabeth revealed while crossing her arms. The excitement of it catching up to her wings as they let loose a tremble. "I might've confessed my suspicions on you're fishy disappearance to a local newspaper company along with some hard driven evidence. Don't worry! Nothing linked to you still being alive or with big wings or anything to do with your current state or location."

Percy was still staring at her wide eyed and aghast. He looked shook as he brought a hand to his forehead as if to rub away some pain.

"Annabeth wha-? Do you realize they'll *hurt* you if they arrest you? What are you going to do?"

"So you're *okay* with me resparking you're closed disappearance case?" She asked curtly.

"Screw that." Percy cursed. "You could be *arrested*. If they're willing to kill me, they're willing to hurt *you* dammit."

"But Perce, the paper-"

"Screw the paper. I don't care if you put ten thousand articles in. You can't be arrested, got it? You have to get away from here." His tone was quickly sinking into panic. Scanning the ceiling and the walls for answers again and again as if they held the secret to everything.

"I'll be fine."

"But you said-"
"They can't arrest me if I'm in the spotlight. I told the paper about how the police claimed you 'drowned' and then quit the case. I told them about your impressive swimming record and how 'your death' could not be so. I told them everything that any outsider could see pertaining to how you disappeared. I also told them that my safety was linked to this article. Uncovering a conspiracy such as this would not put me on the good side of the government so now I'm my own insurance. If I am arrested or disappear, everyone will know your disappearance is trying to be covered up." Annabeth explained calmly but with a dash of unkempt pride at her work. Smiling slightly at the end at Percy with a devilish twist.

"But that doesn't stop you from being blackmailed, or followed, or threatened or investigated. You're not safe. They'll find you out, you'll be taken to heavens knows where because of me!" Percy ran a shaky hand through his hair. Worry scribbled on his face as he pursed his lips.

"I guess I'll just have to live through the danger." Annabeth defiantly jutted her chin out. A sensation of bubbles swirling through her stomach at her newfound bravery. The feeling of *belonging* dancing around like a wind kissed kite. She was going to do this. She was going to get to the bottom of this. This is what she was *meant* to do. No way in hell was Percy going to talk her out of it. Even the words she just spoke didn't taste as cheesy as they were.

"Why." Percy practically choked. Disbelief echoing in his eyes. The fire spasmodically popping from beside them, but Percy didn't flinch a muscle. His gaze never wavering.

"Because." Annabeth left simply.

"But why?"

"Why not?" She challenged. "If I have the chance to make things right then why shouldn't I take it?'

"Because you'll get hurt." Percy pleaded. "We could both get killed."

"Or I could put an end to your hiding. I could get to the bottom of this and get you home. You could go home Perce."

"It's too big of a risk." Percy shook his head. Disbelief written in his every movement as if he were still trying to wrap his brain around it.

"I'm willing to take it." Annabeth huffed. "I've got this."

"You could die."

"I know."

"You're really going to risk your life just so I can get home?" Percy scoffed.

"Yes." Annabeth didn't miss a beat. Her heart beating strong in her chest as she stared Percy down. Knowing *she would.* She would outsmart these guys. She would get Percy home. *She had to.*

Percy obviously wasn't expecting that answer. He looked taken aback. Shocked. For a brief moment he just stared at her astonished. Eyes following the curves of her face before his shoulders sank in defeat.

"Remind me again why I apparently 'don't like you'?" He murmured solemnly. His eyes locking with hers. A look of almost endearment behind his gaze.

"Fabricating a romance for mental security." Annabeth repeated in a breath. A little bewildered at how hard it was to rip her eyes away from him. The amount of magnetism she was experiencing shook her core.

"Bullshit." Percy whispered with a flat tone. Eyes still glued to her. Tension between them suffocating Annabeth in an odd way. Not exactly your run of the mill explosion of emotions.

"Perhaps." she mumbled without thinking. Getting swept up in the moment more than she even realized.

Percy's eyebrows met. "But before you said-"
"I gotta go. It's roughly one in the morning. My mother is going to have me hanged drawn and quartered if she finds out." Annabeth babbled out an excuse. A wave of chills passing through her blood. Packing up her bag and stuff while Percy stood frozen in his spot. Watching her every move.

"But it's pouring buckets out there." he pointed out hesitantly. The constant pitter of the rain against the roof confirming his words.

"Well I need a shower anyways." Annabeth joked. Reaching into her bag and pulling out the tubberware of cookies in one movement.

"Here." she tossed them to him lightly. "Don't devour them all at once, you'll get a stomach ache. Bye now."

She didn't think. She just left. Cheeks burning brighter than any oil lamp had dared to.

-{:oOo:}-

"Annabeth Chase." the voice was demanding and harsh. Annabeth flinched at the severity of it and meekly raised her head to the source. Gripping her pencil sharply as her worst fears were confirmed.

Principal Ashton stood at the door of the class flanked by two intimidatingly tall men in crisp dark suits. Their eyes stabbing into her as she sat frozen at her desk. The rest of her classmates muttering things amongst themselves as the watched with quiet curiosity. It was only the first class of the day.

"Yes Ma'am?" Annabeth managed to find her voice as the principle raised one skeptical eyebrow at her.

"My office. Now." the command was given with the coolness of the ocean but with the undertone of a threat. Still looking regal yet stiff in her pantsuit with her hands clasped in front of her intensely.

"Yes Ma'am." Annabeth stood, her wings vibrating nervously against her back. She wished she had some string or ribbon to keep the darn things in place.

They waited for her.

When she left, the eyes of her classmates following her, the two men fell in on either side of her. Their eyes trained ahead and their shoulders stiff. The smell of fabric cleaner clinging to their suits gave Annabeth a mild headache. It was almost as if they were making sure she wouldn't bolt before they got to the Principal's office.

Principal's *office*. What a mystical place that seemed.

Annabeth had never even *been* to the Principal's office before. She was extraordinarily careful to cover up her tracks when she did pull her pranks so she'd never been caught before. She'd always imagined the place as her prison.

The Principal's office meant being caught. Being caught meant a phone call to her mother and the end of life as she knew it. Being imaginative, she was expecting cold walls and gargoyle like sculptures. Perhaps just a barren room with no windows, a black plastic foldable chair and one dramatic light swinging above said chair.

She was pleasantly surprised to walk into a semi decent room flooded with light.

The floor was carpeted with a rich persian design instead of the cold marble the rest of the school had. The walls composed of thick large stones had heavy wooden framed awards, and pictures, and diplomas neatly organized over the surface. Surprisingly, Principal Ashton had the best windows in Geneth. Four large wide windows streamed in sunlight with divided panes and gold hemming. The view was of the courtyard filled with flowers and vegetables some students grew for projects and experiments. Light grey curtains reaching to the floor beside them. Then there was the more 'Principal' part of the room like the grey filing cabinets lining the wall, and the thick hand carved dark oak desk centered with two comfortable navy chairs across from it. The principles blood red wing backed chair looking more like a throne then anything especially as she took her seat all the while gesturing for Annabeth to sit across from her.

Annabeth complied. Already thinking of a million things this could be about. The time she set off a smoke bomb in ninth grade science class so she could sneak all the frogs out, or the stampede of geese she'd managed to herd into the gym, or the day in grade ten when she set fog horns all throughout the library. But perhaps this had to do with more recent upheavals, and one she'd painted her name on rather boldly. The one completely solid suspicion about the two men was confirmed when Principle Ashton brought out a copy of the daily newspaper and plopped it on her desk.

Annabeth's stomach fizzled. She'd already bought her own copy and torn through it early that morning. Her story was on the top page.

*The first page.*

It was a big deal. The editor she spoke to took it as a deal and pulled through tremendously. Anyone even passing a newstand could stop and read a bit about Percy's story. The writer was even dedicated enough to send out someone to gather official statements from the water rescue center, and Sally Jackson herself. It was a work of word masterpiece and pressing evidence that tied it into a very intriguing and thought provoking piece. Annabeth was thrilled when she read it. Her fears of being arrested diminishing because *everybody* would be suspicious after this.

"It is my understanding that you were the reason this article was created?" Principal Ashton started sternly while pointing to the front page. Her finger landing on the picture of the river Percy *supposedly* drowned in.

"Yep." Annabeth said with ease. Her nervousness dying down as she realized just how untouchable she was. They couldn't do anything to her if this paper was out.

"Well these gentlemen represent the branch of investigation. They don't seem as… humored as you do at this article."

"I had no intention of humoring anyone Mrs. Ashton. The subject of this article is one I felt compelled to share." Annabeth answered tersely.

"You are questioning the very reliability of our ability to investigate serious cases in this article." One of the men spoke up. His voice low and rough as if he'd been a smoker in early years. "Some people are actually *questioning* the police force now too. We can't have this kind of mistrust in a community."

"So am I supposed to to accept the shoddy excuse of an answer you gave Sally Jackson on the disappearance of her son?" Annabeth huffed. Turning to the man to glare daggers at him. Hating him and his ugly butt chin.

"It was a cold case." The other man said with an indifferent shrug. "What it comes down to is that we can't have a little girl running around and stirring the pot like this. If people don't trust the people assigned to protect them then how will their community ever function?"

Annabeth tapped her chin thoughtfully. "Well then." she snuffed. "Find me a suitable explanation on how Sally's boy went missing with some *real* evidence backing the story and people just might start trusting their superiors again."

"Are you trying to get this case reopened?" The first man balked.

*No* she wasn't trying to get the first case reopened. She was trying to make the people suspicious. She was trying to uncover the secret of the wings. She was trying to get Percy home in one piece.

"Maybe." She answered slyly. A brisk yet almost smug smile creeping onto her face. Folding her hands neatly in her lap as if she didn't have a care in the world.

"If we reopen this case, will you retract your previous statements declaring that the government is not to be trusted?" The man raised an eyebrow at her while crossing his arms.

"The deed is done." Annabeth responded indifferently. "It's my opinion and I shan't take my word back on anything."

"But this paper, this *media* against how the government and police force handles things has gained way too much popularity. I don't think you really know the impact of what you're doing. It has to be undone."

"Then prove to them that Percy Jackson's disappearance *isn't* trying to be covered up by you guys. If it's all as simple as you claim, then that should be a piece of cake. The trust will obviously return when suspicions are cleared." She jibed.

"Miss Chase, these men ask of you a very simple task. You are causing *quite* a stir in our little community and I *strongly* suggest you take a hint and help guide things back to normal." Mrs. Ashton's eyes were like ice. The hard tone in her voice making Annabeth a little more irritated.

"No."

"Excuse me?"

"I said no." She said louder. "I'm sorry Mrs. Ashton but I don't recall enrolling in a school for pushovers. This was promised to be one of the most prestigious secondary schools in the country, who's students would go on to change the world. As a *paying* student I am *very* disappointed in your choice of sides." Her hands were in fists befores she knew it. Red crescents biting into her palms from her nails as she fumed in a cold solid way.

"Am I not wise to encourage you to listen to the authorities?" Principal Ashton raised her eyebrow again. A very familiar action to those who were in trouble.

"You are naive to not encourage a student to question the unknown and challenge what seems impossible. I'm questioning the case of Percy Jackson and challenging the authorities to either do something about it or give us the truth. Now good day to you all." Annabeth took to her feet suddenly. Stockily walking to the door with a happy sense of satisfaction at the investigators faces.

"Annabeth Chase, you leave this office I shall have you suspended!" Mrs. Ashton came on on her heels. The calm cold collectiveness gone, her voice straining against the heat of her anger.

"As you might recall Mrs. Ashton, my fight is not with you but the way a disappearance was treated. One of the statements in the article is me explaining on how if something fishy *was* going on then I would be at risk for anything. A suspension might even *deepen* the suspicions of the people so if you are on the side of the authorities you perhaps would like to refrain from causing anymore… damage." Annabeth tried to to feel so bloody proud. Her heart was swelling like a sponge in water and her spine was just prickling with excitement. She felt so powerful, so in control. She felt like she had done something inexplicably useful. It was like she was on top of the world.

*Plus* now that these *investigators* had given her the honour of a small visit she could definitely use it to her advantage. Her impromptu visitors indirectly said that someone higher up had *noticed* the article and wasn't too happy about it.

If this were all nothing (which she knew for a fact it it was something) then nobody up there would have any reason to be concerned or upset. False accusations happened all the time, but hers got attention so that made it different.

"So, I'll bid you for a second time good day and be onto my next class." Annabeth smiled sweetly at Mrs. Ashtons shocked face. Leaving the room and out of the office area with six quick but graceful steps.

*Untouchable* ringing over and over in her ears like a million church bells chiming over a mountainside. Even as she joined the halls filled with students rushing to her next class she could hear it. Whispering in her ear as students calls and laughes and mutters lapped over into a general noise.

"Annabeth!" Piper yelled before tackling her into a hug. Practically squeezing the life out of her best friend while Annabeth choked and squirmed.

"Pipes… air…."

"When I heard you were brought to the Principal's office with two men I was absolutely sure that you'd been hauled off to the slammer!" Piper babbled with her eyes wild. Refusing to let go on her death grip. "But you're here. You're still here!"

"I'll be dead in less than a moment unless you unhand me." Annabeth wheezed.

"Oh, sorry." Pipes mumbled before letting her go. Her stained glass eyes still ever searching as she wrung her hands nervously. "So? What was all the commotion about?"

Annabeth leaned against a locker. A girlishly gleeful smile on her face as her wings shivered. "They wanted me to reclaim my statements. They were *intimidated* by them *obviously*."

"Really?"

"Would I lie to you?"

"Point made." Piper grinned at her.

"I had no idea that *this* would happen. Why is the article so popular?" Annabeth asked thinking Piper wouldn't have a clue along with her. Giving herself a moment to look over her shoulder as if those men dared to follow her.

It was just a dull hallway of students grabbing books. Some looking at her, a few with newspapers piled in there binders. Noisy footsteps knocking against marble floors, and voices echoing off the stone walls.

"Because of this!" Piper practically squealed as she ripped her phone out of the waistband of her kilt. A place frowned upon to keep it, but Piper was somewhat of a rebel.

In two seconds Annabeth was looking at the online release of the article. Her eyebrows pinching in confusion on how this related to anything.

"Uhhh Pipes, what?"

"The comments!" Piper snatched her phone back. Her eyes glued down as she scrolled and pressed a few buttons before shoving it back in Annabeth's general direction.

"It turns out that Percy Jackson's case isn't a unique one. Dozens, even hundreds of people have disappeared across the country and had the same level of uninterested police and investigators work on the cases leaving very unsatisfied loved ones behind. These loved ones of the missing have banded together thanks to *your article*. With so many people and so many fishy cases there is a *mountain* of speculation going on. Some agree with you that the government is either hiding something or covering something up while others assume that it's all thanks to poor police and investigator training."

Piper was right. People were relating and sharing their stories in the comment sections. *Lots* of people. Theories were there too. Some ridiculous ones like alien abduction and human sacrifices to ancient beings. But some were nipping at the truth. Some were suggesting that there was a secret going on that the government was trying to cover up.

*Hundreds…* Annabeth pondered. *Could all of them learned how to fly and been shot down? Exactly how many people figure out how to fly each year?*

"Hey, didn't you have a friend from elementary who disappeared?" Piper asked while cocking her head. "They also presented you with an idiotic explanation?"

Luke.

Annabeth's blood ran cold as it all seemed to click. The puzzle pieces forming the most simple of pictures. *Luke* had a secret the days following up to his sudden vanishing act. Annabeth remembered the way he smiled at her when she asked him where he was going. How he just shook his head and told her maybe when she was older. Then the officers unwillingness to answer her burning questions. How she asked him *why*, why couldn't he tell her the simple things and he said '*I don't know*'.

Luke had to have learned how to fly. If anyone could, he would've been the one. He was shot from the sky just like Grover. He was dead, he was gone.

"Bloody Hell." Annabeth uttered. Feeling like she'd just been smacked with a wet towel. "Bloody Hell, you're right."
