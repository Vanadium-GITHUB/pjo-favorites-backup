So far so good. I kinda forced myself to sit down and write this, so if it feels weird than I guess that's why.

### Chapter 7
The woods suddenly felt hostile to Annabeth. No longer were they the safe haven they had offered her before. She felt as if behind every textured trunk stood a madman, and that every winding branch held a sniper.

The soft rabbit ear moss felt like the blood of the trees and the peaks of jutting rocks and logs littering the ground were just obstacles to keep her from running away. Everything was darker, everything was threatening, everything felt wrong.

She didn't feel safe anymore in those woods. The security of the tall trunks and ceiling of shivering leaves vanished and morphed into a sinking hunted feeling. A feeling like she couldn't escape, like she would be swallowed in seconds by men with guns.

Annabeth endured nonetheless. She marched through that forest like a boss, hopping over the rotting trunks and jagged rocks. Telling herself over and over that there was nothing for her to fear in the woods. The woods would protect her against any meandering hunters. The woods would hide her.

Trudging through the last layer of bramble and bracken, she was finally able to reach her car. The sleek side glinting her wobbly reflection as she threw the doors open, grabbed her target item and disappeared again into the forest. A light yet annoying plastic case now clunking against her side as she walked.

Blessed be that her mother had insisted they keep a fully functional first aid in the vehicle at all times. Seeing as how they lost their father, it was only natural for Athena to persist in insuring the safety of her children.

Hop, crunch, step, duck. Annabeth moved robotically. Only stopping once to exhale in tension before she started her rigorous climb.

"What's that?" Percy asked skeptically once she dragged the case into his little tree house. The plastic clattering against the uneven floor and getting stuck in a rut between two logs. Breathing heavily from all the exercise, Annabeth raised her eyebrow at Percy. Wondering how he didn't catch the prominent red cross against white plastered to the side of the case.

"It's a first aid kit." she wheezed while loosening the tie around her neck and leaning back against the wood wall. Exposing a bit of her collar bone to release the heat that had built up inside her blouse. "Complete with every necessity."

"Necessity?" Percy swallowed. A nervous hiccup in his voice. He tried to cover it up by taking the last bite of his burger. Intentionally avoiding her gaze as he sat stooped over on a stump of fraying wood.

"Everything one needs to keep a person alive." Annabeth explained with one more deliberate breath. Her sparkling grey eyes locking with Percy's. "Or at least until the person can gain access to professional medical attention."

"Why do you have it? I thought you were leaving." A defensive edge was biting in Percy's tone. Immediately his looks turned to wary, and a fight or flight aura seemed to incase him. That guarded hard glint returning to his emerald gaze.

"I'm going to clean you up." Annabeth stated dominantly. Her gaze hardening into a cool collected stare. No heat behind her crystal pools, only determination.

"I'm fine. It stopped bleeding hours ago." he grunted. Crumpling the flaxen fast food burger paper into a ball. His challenged eyes never leaving Annabeth. Sparkling dangerously like a lion stalking its prey.

"Do you want infection?" Annabeth asked tartly. Rising to her feet while gingerly stepping closer to Percy. Minding each step so she wouldn't trip as heat rose in her chest.

"I won't get an infection." Percy growled pointedly. "I'm fine."

"You may be fine now. But with that open wound it's just going to keep breaking open over and over."

"Seriously! I'm-"

"Dammit Percy! Just let me bloody take care of your wound! I'm offering you *help*! Just get your shit together and take my offer! You want to *live* don't you?!" Annabeth snapped. Her face flushed an ungodly shade of red while her hands formed tightened fists. Each syllable was spat with a sense of her tried patience. She felt like an exhausted single mother trying to make her stubborn kid take the medicine already.

Percy was clearly shocked. For a delicious second he sat there with wide eyes and a wordless tongue. Then his face morphed as he set his jaw and glared downward in defeat.

"Fine." he grumbled deeply. Brows furrowed darkly at his loss. "Just let me get the fire started first. It'll be dark soon."

Annabeth sat back and waited patiently. Victory singing in her veins as she watched him grapple with dry grass and some fire starters.

"Sit on the stump, and take your shirt off once you're done." Annabeth instructed without a hint of emotion. Flicking open the plastic lid to the case and running her fingertips over the smooth edge. Anticipating the tools she would need to use.

With a burst of heat the fire roared to life. Setting everything aglow in a warm bath and clinging to the logs set on the stones.

Percy pursed his lips together and stared at the exit with a hint of contemplation. Looking as if he were wondering what his chances were on escape. Then, with a slight sigh and an aggravated grumble, he lumbered over to the sitting log and plopped down. Quickly unhooking the wing slots on his torn tee to lift it away from his body.

The wound was slashed diagonally on the space between each muscle knotted wing base. Tearing deep into his flesh and leaving crusty clots of rusty brown blood clinging to its edges and stretching across the gash.

"Where are these from?" Annabeth scowled at the minor scrapes defacing the rest of Percy's back. Stretching off in different directions and different lengths. Each one red and swollen.

Tentatively she poked one, making Percy flinch in alarm.

"Bloody hell." he cursed. "That fudgin hurt!"

"I thought you said they shot at you! Not put you through a sanding machine." Annabeth raised her eyebrow at him.

"They did shoot at me!" Percy defended. "I got hit, and they were tracing me by the trail of blood I was leaving. So I dove into the creek and accidentally scuffed the bottom a few times."

Annabeth retrieved a little bottle of antiseptic with a bubble in her throat. Delicately she poured a bit onto some cloth and held it up to the gash. Rubbing it lightly to gently remove the layers of scabs.

"Idiot." she hissed. Ignoring how his back tensed from the stinging sensation that was probably racing across his skin. "If I don't do this right, you're probably going to get an infection from that scummy stream water."

"I'm not going to get an infection." Percy grumbled stubbornly.

"Can't say that. You can't be sure." Annabeth shot back as she delicately picked up the first aid box again. A slight quiver in her hands and a turmoil in her gut.

What next? What did she have to do after sterilizing?

Did she go straight for the needle and silk? No no, that didn't feel right. Was there a numbing agent she was supposed to apply?

No numbing agent.

Collecting her scattered nerves, Annabeth took a deep breath through her nose. The tremble in her heart drifting away as she tried to clear her head.

*That's right, I have to prep the cut.* Her mind grew focused in the nick of time. Gingerly selecting the surgical scissors, she washed them down with the hydrogen peroxide. Momentarily she held them up to the flickering fire light, watching them glint in hopes of catching a place she missed cleaning.

That's when she noticed Percy was watching her. His head subtly bent in her direction and staring intently at her from the corner of his eye. A sharp look embedded in his swirling green pools. His eyes gleaming with uncertainty and doubt as if he were still questioning if he should take flight.

"This is gonna hurt." Annabeth mumbled. Suddenly questioning if she could do this, if she could manage to make it through. "But you have to endure it till the end, okay?"

Percy grunted instead of answering. Dipping his head away from her as his majestic wings shivered momentarily. Defiantly trying to hide the fear that was written all over him.

Annabeth didn't hesitate. She carefully pulled at the layer of ragged skin and cut it away from his body in a straight line.

Immediately Percy's back arched in acute pain. His wings recoiled into a folded position as a long hiss emitted from his clenched jaw. Shudders arched down his spine that caused a moment of panic to flutter in Annabeth's gut.

"It's okay." She tried to sooth. "I have to do this, but once it's all done you'll be okay."

Percy didn't respond. His head was hunched down as if he was trying to hide the pain. The flickering of the firelight now depicted hellish shadows across his bare skin.

Delicately, Annabeth grazed her fingers over the thick base of his wings. Brushing the downy feathers with the tips of her fingers, trying to ease his wings away from his back.

"Spread your wings." she mumbled quietly. "You have to keep them open, you have to get through this."

At first Percy doesn't respond to her.

*He'll tuck his wings in closer. He's not going to listen to me.*

But Percy did listen. Slowly he unfurled his wings and let them droop to his sides. Exposing that tender gash to Annabeth's less than skillful hands again. His head tilted sideways slightly to watch her once again with that flightly look.

"Try to think of something else." she advises. Working her tracing hands closer to the gash. Feeling like she was working with a wild animal rather than a person.

"It's hard to think of anything else." Percy all but growls. "My back felt like it was on fire when you did that." he says. But there's no accusing tone in his voice. Just fed up. Fed up with the pain perhaps, or maybe just constantly living in fear and filth.

"I know." Annabeth purses her lips. Sighing at the fact that she must go through with this. That she had to make him better. "But you have to try okay? You have to."

"What do I think about?" it's a plain question, but it's a question Annabeth seizes immediately. Wings fluttering slightly in excitement.

"Do I perhaps have your trust?" She poises the question hesitantly. "Could you tell me about everything?"

*What if I've crossed a line?*

"Everything, everything?" he sounds scared.

*Does he think I'll butcher him if he doesn't?*

"Not if you don't want to share." Annabeth sighs. Staring at the surgical scissors in her hands as she feels his eye on her. Her heart feeling heavy as he stays silent.

"My mom's probably missing me." the words come from his mouth so quietly she almost missed them. "She's the most wonderful person in the world…"

"Tell me what makes her so." Annabeth holds her breath as she aligns the scissors again. Cringing as she brings the blades together.

"She's forgiving, and- and kind." Percy manages to grit out as his hands formed fists. Beads of sweat gathering around his neck and starting to coat his back.

"And?" Annabeth persists. Feeling tense and awful. Like she's screwing up every move in every possible way.

*Snip.*

"She's the best cook." Percy pants after a moment of wing fluttering pain. Unhunching his shoulders as the throbs die down.

"I'm moving on to stitching, okay?" Annabeth hurriedly grabs at the box and tosses the bloodied scissors in. Taking a piece of cloth to dab at the new flow of blood dribbling down his back. "Tell me what she cooks. What's your favorite food from her?"

"Cookies." Percy mutters before the curved needle is threaded. "Blue chocolate chip cookies. She makes the best. They have just enough chocolate that they're gooey, but enough dough to be chewy and soft."

In goes the needle as it hooks around the first wall of flesh. Percy hisses again, and lets loose a half winded groan. His back glistening from sweat and finding the curves of his muscles.

"Where does your mom live?" Annabeth keeps the questions coming. Threading the needle again and again without hesitancy.

"Livol C-County." he moans painfully. His head hung low again. His wings itching to retract and hide the gash from her. "S-she has a -a farm on Tellest road."

"Did she know you could fly?" Annabeth asks as she see's the end. Her line of somewhat sloppy stitches almost reaching the end of the gash.

"The day I learned to fly, I never saw h-her again." Percy grunts. His shoulders still tense as Annabeth ties off the stitches.

With a sigh of relief, Annabeth sits back and stares. Percy, still bent over on the log infront of her let's loose a long exhale.

"Does anyone besides myself know that you, Percy Jackson, can fly?" It's a loaded question and she knows it. She knows that he just might answer her questions now.

But should she take advantage of his weakness?

In the end, it doesn't matter because Percy doesn't respond. His red stitched back looks red and irritated, his wings look deflated and lifeless. A certain element of defeat is written in is stance like a wolf broken by a hunter.

Silently, Annabeth starts covering the stitches in bandages for extra protection. Layering some gauze in between to keep it all sealed nicely. Listening the the friendly crackle of the fire and smelling that deep pine smoke wood scent that reminded her of christmas.

"My best friend." Percy whispers when she's wrapping the bandages around his chest to hold them. His deep green eyes sad as they lock with Annabeth's grey ones. She's entranced by how vivid they are, how emotion filled.

"My best friend, Grover, figured out how to fly with me. We were so overjoyed and so freaking naive." Percy choked out. Tears gathering in his eyes as his lips turned down in a sour look. "We thought we were so clever, being the first ones to know that we could fly. We thought we'd be famous."

A silence followed and Percy looked away. Perhaps changing his mind on telling Annabeth, or letting her know a bit about who he was.

"And?" Annabeth asked. Timidly reaching up to touch his hand.

"We wanted to fly to town to show everyone. But before we even got there… they shot at us. People in jeeps and helicopters came out of nowhere. We tried to escape but…"

Percy let go of a shaky breath. The first tear broke the boundaries of his eyes and slipped silently to the ground. Shining ever so lightly in the warm fire glow.

"Grover couldn't keep up. I tried to help him but … they shot him out of the sky. He fell… and I ran like a coward. I… I hid like a coward."

"You are the farthest thing from a coward." Annabeth was surprised by the hardness in her voice. They way she sounded was defiant and rough, but in a caring way. Such a weird mingle of tones. "Anyone else would've given up by now with the living conditions you have, anyone else would've given themselves in."

Percy rubbed his eyes with a bit of embarrassment. "You think so?" he asked hopefully.

Annabeth nodded reassuringly. Confidence shining in her sparkling grey eyes. "I know so."

-{:oOo:}-

Surprisingly, Annabeth managed to *enjoy* some conversation with Percy that night. Blatant small talk and nothing anything deeper but still. She left the treehouse when the stars were out and the moon was high, telling him that he couldn't fly for a few days and demanding that he rest like some nervous nurse.

And he joked about it as if they were friends.

Odd, how Annabeth had only met Percy three days prior and yet she could feel like he was just that.

A friend. A person she could wholeheartedly trust. And if she were honest with herself (which rarely happens) she would admit that she couldn't wait to go back to that ram sham treehouse and help him out.

He's not a bad person. Annabeth finally admitted to herself as she pulled into the driveway of her dark home. Being sure to be extra quiet as she shut the door to her mom's car.

Cautiously she crept up the front steps and inserted her keys into the door before walking in as quietly as she could. Each noise sounding like thunder to her ears as she tried to sneak like a tiger. Her heart beat striking with adrenaline and coursing through her ears.

In a shock of brightness the lights to the front hall came on. Forcing Annabeth to squint as her chest sank. The light revealing Athena sitting pin straight and unamused on a kitchen chair. Her work clothes still on at this late hour and her eyes filled with pure and unmerciful disappointment.

"I send you on a simple errand and you take it as your key to goof off." her voice was hard and angry. Filled with venom at the idea that the girl before her was *her* daughter.

"Mother I-"

"No excuses." Athena snapped. Her steely grey eyes as sharp as knifes and just as menacing. "I took it upon myself to find your whereabouts. I called the Mcleans, and do you know what they informed me of?"

Annabeth swallowed heavily. Her heart constricting and painful tears erupting out the corner of her eyes. Biting them down, she straightened her posture.

"What did they inform you of?"

"That you have not been a guest at their home for the entirety of the evening! Honestly Annabeth! Where have you been?"

"I… I…" Annabeth mumbled. Her eyes falling from her mother's in shame.

"Come! Out with it! Don't mutter and stutter like some wretched illiterate on the side of a scummy street!"

Biting her lip, Annabeth felt the defiance nipping in her heart die. The feeling of failure to being the perfect daughter soiling her heart.

"I was nowhere." Annabeth whispered. Her heart clenching as she held back the waterfall of tears.

*Why can't I ever be good enough?*

"Oh never mind." Athena huffed in indignation. "Get out of my sight. I can't stand to even look at you!"

Somberly, Annabeth tried to get up the stairs with her back as straight as possible. Her perfect mask of serene calmness and quiet elegance hiding the ugly feelings of failure and self disappointment.

"Oh, and Annabeth!" Her mother called after her in one commanding call.
Annabeth tried not to cringe as she turned to look at her.

"My dear friend Clarice Aresto called upon me this morning since she has just moved back to her old estate. We are to have afternoon tea at her place tomorrow. I shall pick you an hour early from school to prepare for it."

Annabeth couldn't hold back her surprise. "Miss school?" she gaped.

Athena's brows furrowed. "A lady doesn't question her mother, Annabeth."

"Apologies Mother." Annabeth stated robotically. Lacking feeling in her voice.

"If you must know, Clarice helped us out stupendously when your father passed away. She wishes to see how you've grown. Though I daresay you haven't grown very well if you are coming home this late."

Another stab, another moment when the mask hid it all.

"Understood Mother."

"Very well, go off to bed. We shall discuss your unruly behaviour and where you have been another day." Athena warned with one last look of distaste.

"Goodnight Mother." Annabeth offered no other words as she walked stiffly to her room. Shutting the door softly before she dared to let the silent tears free fall from her face. Watching the familiar sight as the droplets dripped to the floor.

*Why can't I be good enough for her?*
